  <div><DIV>  <P><FONT face=Arial>Just how do you behave in that awkward moment when the bill   arrives at a group meal?</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>Together we've rifled through the cutlery drawer, extended   the hand of respectful friendship to the waiter and decided once and for all   that there's no place for flash photography in a temple of gastronomy, but�in   typical British fashion�this series has, thus far, skirted awkwardly around the   delicate subject of money.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>However much we like to pretend otherwise as we relax into a   well-cushioned seat and a glass of wine, at some point the fact becomes   unavoidable: eating at a restaurant is a business transaction like any other.   We've eaten and drunk our way through commodities that don't come for free,   enjoyed (or endured) the service of a host of employees, both front of house and   behind the scenes�yet for some reason we find the idea of paying for it all   excruciating.</FONT></P>  <P align=right><FONT face=Arial><IMG   style="BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 0px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 0px solid; BORDER-TOP: #000000 0px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 0px solid"   id=1826899 title="" border=0 alt=买单也要讲策略 align=right   src="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/language_tips/book/attachement/jpg/site1/20090918/0013729e41a90c1d70c63f.jpg"   width=332 height=217 md5="" sourcedescription="编辑提供的本地文件"   sourcename="本地文件"></FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>Every one of us, at some time or another, have found   ourselves embroiled in a heated, yet determinedly "jovial" argument on the   arrival of the bill�"No, no, NO � let ME!" we screech through fixed grins, as we   claw at the offending scrap of paper. So what's the most gracious way to avoid a   Mrs Doyle-style punch-up over a 75p cuppa?</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>If you're hosting the meal, and intend to pay for it, the   situation is relatively simple�as our old friend Emily Post so sagely opined   back in 1922, "For a host to count up the items is suggestive of parsimony,   while not to look at them is disconcertingly reckless, and to pay before their   faces for what his guests have eaten is embarrassing … Therefore, to avoid this   whole transaction, people who have not charge accounts, should order the meal   ahead, and at the same time pay for in advance, including the waiter's   tip."</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>Although, in these days of allergies and picky eating, I   wouldn't advise ordering ahead, a seemly modern solution is to slip off near the   end of the meal as if to the loo, and settle up discreetly while you're away   from the table, thus forestalling any protest.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>But what if you're (oh dreadful phrase!) splitting the bill?   In my experience, people who have hitherto appeared perfectly charming can   become monsters on the presentation of the damage. "I only had one drink," they   announce in an aggressive tone, eyeballing you in a fashion that leaves no doubt   that they are well aware that you have not been so abstemious. And when the   assorted notes are added up, and fall mysteriously short, it's never them who   offer to help make up the extra, even though you suspect them of having been   rather mean in their calculation of their share of the tip.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>Unless I know that someone around the table is really hard   up, and has chosen accordingly, I favour just splitting the bill equally�after   all, everyone had the option of choosing whatever they wanted, and to nitpick   about your risotto being cheaper than his steak can spoil the atmosphere   remarkably swiftly. Non-drinkers, of course, should be automatically excused the   cost of the claret.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>If you are trying to save money (and let's face it, if   you're going out to dinner, it's probably not a question of being on the poverty   line, more that you'd prefer to spend your cash elsewhere), you can do it   subtly.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>Economists suggest that people are more likely to order   extravagantly when they think others will be sharing the cost, so it would be   sensible to explain early on (without fuss) that you're on a bit of a budget, so   you're only going to have a main course, and then put down what you owe, plus a   reasonable tip, as soon as the bill arrives, before anyone can mention splitting   it. But unless you're in dire straits, don't be mean about it, and ask for the   50p change you're owed�leave it for the waiter.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>What do you think � is splitting the bill friendly or   ridiculous? Should we forswear this nonsense and simply pay for what we've   ordered, or would we be missing out on an important element of sharing a meal?   And, most of all, will anyone admit to taking advantage of their fellow diners   when they know they'll all be sharing the cost?</FONT></P></DIV></div>
