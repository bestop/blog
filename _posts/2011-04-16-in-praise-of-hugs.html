Neither of my parents was the   cuddly type. Greetings involving kissing caused me to wince, and hugging   generally just made me feel awkward.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>Then one hug changed all that. One month before my 40th   birthday my dad had heart surgery. As he came round, days later, he grabbed me   and hugged me so hard I had to push with all my might to keep my head from   pressing down on his newly stitched torso.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>It was a hug to make up for all those we had never had. Days   later as he slowly started to gain strength he told me for the first time ever   that he loved me, and through my tears I told him I loved him too.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>I began planning how to bake him better � with carrot cakes,   victoria sponges, jelly and ice cream. My maternal streak kicked in and I   fantasised about wheeling him through the park and feeding him home-made   goodies. Then he died.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>I felt cheated. All my life I had wondered whether my dad   cared for me and loved me � I doubted it. Just as I got proof that he did, he   passed away.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>My parents split up when I was two years old and, while I   had monthly contact with my dad, my bitter stepmother and my father's   old-fashioned stiff upper lip meant we never became close. In fact, I used to   dread the visits to see him and count the hours until I could go home   again.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>When I was very little the weekends at my father's house   felt cold and unfriendly. During my teens the trips to a hostile house became a   dread on the horizon for weeks beforehand. Each stay culminated in an   uncomfortable peck on the cheek from Dad as he said goodbye � a moment I cringed   about for hours in advance.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>And yet standing beside the hospital bed watching the life   ebb from my sleeping father was painful. I felt like a little girl at his   bedside, unable to talk to him yet again. I became fixated with his fingers �   fat and soft, lying gently curled beside him. Slowly they transformed from plump   sausages to stone � white and immovable. It was his fingers that told me he had   gone from this life, not the bleeping of monitors or the bustling of nursing   staff.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>Losing a father whom you have no recollection of ever living   with is difficult. Grieving is tricky; I didn't have any obvious close   father-daughter memories to cling to and mull and cry over. Most of my memories   were of stilted meetings and uncomfortable times together. But I desperately   missed him being alive.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>As time moved on my grief and anger at his untimely death   began to recede. I realised that his affirmation of me from his deathbed had   filled a gaping hole of insecurity I had constantly carried around.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>To a child a hug says so many things. It tells you that the   person hugging you loves you, cares for you. A hug also confirms that you are a   lovable being. Months after Dad's death I realised with a jolt that his lack of   hugs said more about him than me. My father was not a demonstrative man and I   was, therefore, perhaps, a lovable being.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>Once I digested this insight my feelings changed from those   of a needy child to ones of a very proud daughter. Looking at my father more   objectively allowed me to view him clearly: he was a man of few words; he was   intelligent, kind and extremely modest. Ironically I began to feel closer to him   in death than I had while he was alive.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>With this new-found wisdom came the freedom to give up   trying so very hard to gain the affections of others and to concentrate on   finding me. I shattered the family taboo of silence about the break-up of my   parents' marriage. I also felt the need to speak out about the detrimental   effect I felt my step-parents had had on my life.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>In some ways the consequences have been quite dire and I no   longer have contact with my mother. However, Dad's hug had a profound effect on   me. It carried me along a path from childhood to adulthood. At last I am my own   woman and one who loves nothing better than a good old-fashioned   hug.</FONT></P></DIV>  <DIV><FONT face=Arial></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV></div>
