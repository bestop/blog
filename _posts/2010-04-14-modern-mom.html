My daughter just turned&nbsp;15   and suddenly I am now the most embarrassing person she can be seen with. Rather   than take this personally I have decided to revel in the power it gives   me.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Of course   many of you have had the "You aren't wearing THAT" argument but I turned the   tables on my daughter. She was wanting to wear midriff tops and tanks with bra   straps showing … both of which I had been carefully taught were fashion no-no's.   The other day I picked her up from school and stopped at the grocery store.   "Mom! You can't go in dressed like that!" "I am staying in the car!"</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Imagine ... a   50-year-old dressed just like her 15-year-old, and she does not want to be seen   with me. Well ... I admit the embarrassment was worth every moment...she has now   dressed a bit more conservatively. She HAD to go in the store with me as it was   too hot to sit in the car. It was a priceless moment that also was a bit cheeky   of me to enjoy so much.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Recently she   wanted to dye her beautiful auburn hair black. Yes she has naturally beautiful   auburn hair but wants it to be black because she states, "Auburn is SO boring!"   Of course my reply, "Oh my gosh … women all over the world for die for your   hair!" was ineffective, however, as I plopped the box of purple hair dye onto   the counter and said "Sure, just as soon as I am finished dying mine   purple."</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Yep, the   purple dye sat on the counter ... I had called her bluff. "Perhaps if we both   wait a couple weeks and you still insist on dying your hair black, mine will be   purple just in time for me to chaperon your next school dance. That is coming up   in two weeks, right? I bet your friends will think I am the coolest mom there!"   She is visibly cringing. I can see thoughts racing through her mind. Her mom   with purple hair at her school dance.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>I am praying,   please, PLEASE don't dare me to go with purple hair, but I stand firm. "Yes, I   think I'd be pretty with purple hair. It is Dad's favorite color." She knows it   really is his favorite color. Finally she shrugs and says "Nevermind." Whew ...   she changed her mind. I am so relieved but I keep rambling on about purple hair   as she leaves the room.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>She knows I   would do it. I have done sillier things to prove a point. I am not sure how long   I can keep this up. I am praying she does not ask about piercing next, but I   have already asked my husband to pick up a pamphlet from our nearest piercing   place, just so I can whip it out and show her which one "Mom" might get, too. Of   course she may never go that far. I am hoping ... praying ... and a bit nervous.   When "Mom" wants to do it too―suddenly it just isn't that cool.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Yep ... I can   be pretty silly. Looking at life with humor makes it bearable sometimes. It   isn't all fun and games.</FONT></P></DIV></DIV></div>
