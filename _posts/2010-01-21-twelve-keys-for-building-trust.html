  <div><DIV>  <DIV class=sanjineiwen>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>The foundation of any   relationship, whether it be with a Business associate, spouse, parent, client   or, friend, is trust. Trust is not something that can be built with quick fix   techniques. Rather, it is something that is cultivated through consistent habits   in your interactions. The following are twelve patterns of behavior that   increase trust in your relationships.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><STRONG><FONT face=Arial>1. Be   transparent</FONT></STRONG></P>  <P align=left><FONT face=Arial><IMG style="WIDTH: 239px; HEIGHT: 242px"   id=891761 title="" border=0 alt="Twelve Keys for Building Trust" align=left   src="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/language_tips/book/attachement/jpg/site1/20080711/0013729e42d209e13e1703.jpg"   zmxid="zoomXimageId6" md5="" sourcedescription="编辑提供的本地文件"   sourcename="本地文件"></FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial></FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Do not try to hide things from   others. Refuse to have any hidden agendas. You might think you can pull a fast   one on someone else. You can't. Most people have good intuition and even though   they may not be able to consciously determine that you are hiding something,   they very likely will have an uneasy feeling around you. If they don`t feel   comfortable around you, they won't be able to trust you.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Another sinister aspect of   having hidden agenda is that it erodes your ability to trust others. You will   assume that if you aren't fully forthcoming, other people aren't either. When   you are trustworthy, however, you will see others as more trustworthy   too.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><STRONG><FONT face=Arial>2. Be   sincere</FONT></STRONG></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>This is similar to the previous   point. Only say what you mean. Be impeccably honest with your words. Refuse to   try and craft your words to manipulate others. Don`t give fake compliments,   patronize others or say something just because you think you are supposed to.   Again, people have good BS detectors. When others know that you only speak   genuinely, it increases their capacity to trust you. Everyone loves   authenticity.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><STRONG><FONT face=Arial>3. Focus on adding   value</FONT></STRONG></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>In any relationship, always   have the best interest of others at heart. Work hard to give as much or more   than you get. When you consistently add value to someone`s life, they not only   feel like you are on their side, they also have the urge to reciprocate. In   Business relationships, this means always under-promise and over-deliver. In   personal relationships, focusing on meeting the needs of the other person   instead of taking in order to get your own needs met.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><STRONG><FONT face=Arial>4. Be   present</FONT></STRONG></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>The last thing anyone wants is   to have a conversation with someone who isn't there. Instead of retreating into   your head, focus on listening to others. Whenever you are with someone, make   them your primary focus. Don't think about work while you are at Home talking to   your spouse. Don't think about life at Home when you are with a client. When it   comes to relationships, presence means quality time and quality time builds   trust.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><STRONG><FONT face=Arial>5. Always treat people   with respect</FONT></STRONG></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Ever since we were little kids,   we have been taught to be respectful. However, when our standards get violated   or there is no one around to see (read: we don`t think there will be any   consequences), we can often engage in petty behavior. This encompasses a wide   range of actions from personal attacks during arguments to gossiping behind   someone's back.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Always remember that another   person's inherent worth as a human being entitles them to be treated with   dignity. When people know that you will always treat with them respect, it is   very natural for trust to flourish.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><STRONG><FONT face=Arial>6. Take   responsibility</FONT></STRONG></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>When you mess up, which you   invariably will, be quick to clean it up. Skip the excuses and just take   responsibility. Justifying and making excuses may help you in the short term but   in the long run, it does nothing for your character or the level of trust you   are given. Accountability is a rare trait these days with most people wanting to   avoid negative consequences at all costs. Dare to be different and you will win   the trust of others.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><STRONG><FONT face=Arial>7. Focus on   feedback</FONT></STRONG></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Unless you`re a mind reader,   the only way you can know how well a relationship is going is by getting   feedback from the other person. Be not only willing to accept feedback �   actively seek it out. Many people are afraid to give you feedback, especially if   its negative, out of fear that they will offend. Ask with sincerity and respond   respectfully and others will be far more willing. Take both the positive and   negative into account along with your own judgment and adjust your behaviour   accordingly.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><STRONG><FONT face=Arial>8. Take criticism   well</FONT></STRONG></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Learn to handle criticism with   grace. Instead of getting defensive, consider the possibility that what the   other person is saying might be true. Closing yourself off from criticism has   the effect of closing off all communication.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>In some cases, the criticism   may indeed be inaccurate. In these instances, you have the opportunity to show   empathy. Try to understand the problem from the other person's point of view.   Perhaps the criticism is just a thinly veiled attack that stems from a deeper   upset they may have with you. In these cases, your willingness to dig deeper   without getting defensive will certainly enhance the trust in the   relationship.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><STRONG><FONT face=Arial>9. Set   boundaries</FONT></STRONG></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Be clear about how you expect   people to behave around you. Again, do this in a mature manner: be sincere and   respectful. When you have clear standards, people know exactly how to behave   around you and that gives them certainty. The strength that you communicate by   setting boundaries builds trust � when someone knows that they can`t take   advantage you that alleviates the fear that someone else will.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><STRONG><FONT face=Arial>10. Be a class   act</FONT></STRONG></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Hold yourself to a higher a   standard. Be quick to apologize when you know you are wrong. Only speak well of   others, even those who don`t speak well of you.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Why should you do this? First,   imagine what it would do to your sense of self to know that other people only   have good experiences with you. Second, imagine how much trust such behaviour   engenders in others. Finally, imagine the example you set for others � the   conduct of others will improve just by being around you consistently.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><STRONG><FONT face=Arial>11. Your word is your   bond</FONT></STRONG></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Keep all the promises you make   and ensure that you make promises only sparingly. Make your word stronger than   any written contract. Refuse to make empty promises and manipulate   people.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>When a promise you have made is   no longer beneficial to you, instead of deciding to not follow through, attempt   to renegotiate the deal. When you renegotiate the agreement, ensure that the new   commitment provides even more value to the other person.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><STRONG><FONT face=Arial>12. Be   consistent</FONT></STRONG></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Above all, be consistent in   your behavior. Don't engage in the behavior once in a while when it seems   convenient. Your consistency is the key to your trustworthiness. Small actions   add up and a track record of high character is invaluable in any relationship.   Become intensely principle-centered and trust will follow easily and   consistently.</FONT></P></DIV></DIV></div>
