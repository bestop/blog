  <div><DIV>  <DIV class=3jbiaoti><FONT face=Arial>"Mom, you should put some of your things   away. Baby proof this house," stated our oldest son Mark as he lumbered up the   stairs followed by his wife, Kim, and fifteen－month－old Hannah.</FONT></DIV>  <DIV class=3jineiwen>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Visiting for the Thanksgiving   holiday, he finished unloading the luggage and took it to the guestroom   downstairs. After driving all day from Salt Lake to Ft. Collins, his temper   showed. "That one finger rule may work with the twins, but it'll never work with   Hannah, " he insisted.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>When my three granddaughters   were born four months apart and the twins moved into our house at eight months,   my close friend offered me her secret to entertaining grandchildren with few   mishaps. "Teach them the 'one finger rule'." All of her five grandchildren   learned it at a young age. The success of the method surprised me.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>I picked up my granddaughter   and said, "Well, Mark, you just watch." I hugged her and walked all around the   great room.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"Hannah, you may touch anything   in this room you want. But, you can only use one finger." I demonstrated the   technique by touching my forefinger to the African sculpture on the mantle.   Hannah followed my example. "Good girl. Now what else would you like to   touch？"</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>She stretched her finger toward   another object on the mantle. I allowed her to touch everything in sight,   plants, glass objects, TV, VCR, lamps, speakers, candles and artificial flowers.   If she started to grab, I gently reminded her to use one finger. She always   obeyed. But, Hannah, an only child, possessed a more adventur ous personality.   Her father predicted it would prevent her from accepting the"one   finger"rule.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>During their four-day stay, we   aided Hannah in remembering"one finger"rule. She learned quickly. I only put   away the things that might prove to be a danger to a child. Otherwise, we   watched her closely and nothing appeared to suffer any damage. Besides,   "things"can be replaced.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>A few fingerprints on glass   doors, windows and tables remained after Hannah and her family returned home. I   couldn't bring myself to clean them for days. Each one reminded me of some   wonderful experience with Hannah.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Months later, my husband and I   drove to Salt Lake; I watched Mark and Kim continue to practice the one finger   rule. But I refrained from saying, "I told you so." Yet, I smiled inwardly each   time they prodded Hannah to touch with "one finger. " Mark, a salesman, always   gave a packet of gifts to his potential clients. The night before we returned   home, Mark sat on the floor stuffing gifts into their packets. Hannah   helped.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Then she picked up one gift,   held it in her hand as if it were a fragile bird, and walked toward me. At my   knee, her beautiful blue eyes looked into mine. She stretched her prize to me   and said, "One finger, Nana!"</FONT></P></DIV></DIV></div>
