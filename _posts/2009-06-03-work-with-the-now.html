  <div><DIV>"过去"的一切已经成为了过往，你正经历的是"现在"。花费越少的时间和精力回顾"过去"，你就有更多的时间来品味"现在"。不要让对于过去的懊恼和担心消磨了你的斗志。不论过去经历过什么，从中汲取教训，继续前行吧。当你有足够的动力这样做时，你会发现，勇敢前行是对生活最好的诠释。   <BR>　　 <BR>　　There are some people who are completely happy with themselves,   their lives, and their prospects for the future. While they can be considered to   be more fortunate than most, most who do not fall into that category are not as   bad off as they tend to believe. Instead, they are simply lacking something, or   making mistakes, which are standing in the way of their lives being as   fulfilling as they would prefer. Some even go as far as to not realize the   immense potential they possess. <BR>　　 <BR>　　What is the main difference between   those lucky individuals whose lives seem to be wonderfully on-track and those   who, often despite every step of trying on their part, appear to have all of the   odds stacked against them? While in some cases it is a matter of some people   having better luck than others, those whose lives are content in the moment and   proceeding in the direction of their choice, do not live in the past. <BR>　　   <BR>　　 <BR>　　Whether you are thinking about your personality or your life in   general, success means focusing on the here-and-now. While it is important to   acknowledge the choices and experiences which resulted in you being where you   are today, it is equally important to not allow yourself to become so caught up   in thoughts of the past that the present day passes you by. <BR>　　   <BR>　　Self-motivation is the key to ensuring that you do not continue repeating   the same mistakes. You may have had one or more errors in judgment which led you   to take the wrong path, or to make mistakes that were not in your best interest.   You can acknowledge this without rehashing them over and over again in your   mind, and simply be determined to make different, better decisions today. <BR>　　   <BR>　　Then is over; this is now. The less time and effort you put into looking   at the past, the more you will have for living and experiencing this day. You   will also find that letting go of the past will give you a deeper sense of   strength. Instead of allowing past mistakes and worries to drain your energies,   you will have a renewed energy to live your life to the fullest and enjoy it   more. <BR>　　 <BR>　　Being content with yourself and optimistic about your future   is not difficult. Whatever is in the past is over; learn from it and move on.   When you are self-motivated enough to do this, you will see that moving ahead is   the best definition of living life. <BR>　　 <BR>　　With that said, what can you do   now? Sure it is easy for me to tell you to forget the past, yet it is a whole   different practice to actually do it. Life is a complex set of events much of   which of course is real, yet a large amount is just your view of what really   happened. <BR>　　 <BR>　　Let me explain with an example. I know not everyone is a   football fan but I am guessing most have watched at least part of a game on TV.   Most plays and almost all the important plays are played over and over on the TV   screen right after the play happened. <BR>　　 <BR>　　How many times have you   watched a play and were certain and I mean certain of the outcome, say the   player caught a pass, then watching the instant replay you realize you were   totally wrong, the player dropped the pass. What you were certain you saw, never   happened. <BR>　　 <BR>　　The first step in trying to minimize the effects of your   past in order to concentrate on your future is to find out how much of the past   that you are certain happened were just mistakes on your part. <BR>　　 <BR>　　A   quick example might be as a teenager you tried to build a piece of furniture out   of scrape wood in your father's workshop. The piece of furniture looked good   when you finished but fell apart before you could show your father and you   assumed your were a lousy carpenter and the rest of your life you have avoided   building anything. Yet the reality was the scrap wood you used was faulty and   not your building ability. <BR>　　 <BR>　　Yet the rest of your life you have   believed mistakenly you are a poor builder of things.</DIV></div>
