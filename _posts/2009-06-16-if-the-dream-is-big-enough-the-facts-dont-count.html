She would practice dribbling and shooting over and over again, sometimes until dark. One day I asked her why she practiced so much. She looked directly in my eyes and without a moment of hesitation she said,&quot;I want to go to college. The only way I can go is if I get a scholarship. I like basketball. I decided that if I were good enough, I would get a scholarship. I am going to play college basketball. I want to be the best.

Quietly I asked what was wrong. &quot;Oh, nothing,&quot; came to a soft reply. &quot;I'm just too short.&quot; The coach told her that at&quot;5'5&quot; she would probably never get to play for a top ranked team-- much less offered a scholarship-- so she should stop dreaming about college.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>  <p style='mso-margin-top-alt:0pt;margin-right:2.25pt;margin-bottom:11.25pt; margin-left:2.25pt;text-indent:-.8pt;line-height:15.0pt'><font size=2 face=Arial><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>She was heartbroken and I felt my own throat tighten as I sensed her disappointment.

He told her that if she really wanted to play for a good college, if she truly wanted a scholarship, that nothing could stop her except one thing-- her own attitude.
