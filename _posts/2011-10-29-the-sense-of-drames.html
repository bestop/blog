  <div>Preparing to sit an exam we&#39;re not prepared for, or our teeth falling<br>out...Our dream world throws up bizarre and confusing images that make<br>little sense.<br>惊醒！梦见自己坐在考场里两眼一抹黑? 或者……牙怎么突然掉了? 这些奇奇怪怪的梦境让人不知所措，真是大伤脑筋！<br>After analyzing more than 100,000 dreams, a British scientist has<br>found that dreams reflect fundamental life patterns and, by<br>understanding them, you can see your life in a new light.<br>一位英国科学家在对超过10万个梦境案例分析后得出结论：梦境是真实生活的写照。如果理解了梦境的含义，说不定能让生活重现曙光呢！<p>【梦境1：被追】<br>YOU&#39;RE BEING CHASED<p>You find yourself being pursued by something or someone you feel is<br>going to harm you. No matter how fast you run, or where you hide, you<br>can&#39;t escape them.<br>梦见有东西狂追自己，说不清是人是鬼，总觉得再跑慢点就会挂掉! 可是无论跑多快，无论藏到哪里，就是摆脱不了。这是为什么?<p>*解梦*<br>Whatever is chasing you is an aspect of yourself, which is why you<br>cannot escape it.<br>无论后面追你的是什么，其实就是你自己，这就是为什么你怎么逃也逃不掉的原因(悲催)。<p>It represents a part of you or a situation you are scared to confront.<br>Identify what is causing tension in your waking life. It might seem<br>easier to avoid it but, you need to be assertive and resolve it.<br>你目前是不是不敢面对自己或正身处困境，而选择逃避? 首先静下心来想一想，到底生活中有什么事情让你如此困扰! 逃避似乎更容易，但最好的办法还是挺直腰板去面对它吧!<p>【梦境2：掉牙】<br>YOUR TEETH FALL OUT<p>You notice that some of your teeth are becoming loose and starting to<br>fall out. Or your teeth crumble into powder. You might also be looking<br>in the mirror and realize your teeth are decayed or that you have<br>grown vampire fangs.<br>梦里，突然感觉牙齿松动脱落，或者碎成粉末。照照镜子，牙齿怎么烂成这个鬼样子? 乖乖，连吸血鬼的尖牙都长出来了!<p>*解梦*<br>You show your teeth when you smile and when you bite, so they reflect<br>how self-assured and assertive you feel. Teeth falling out indicates<br>that a situation is causing you to lose confidence. Vampire teeth<br>indicate you are relying on other people to provide your<br>self-assurance.<br>想想什么时候才能露出牙齿? 微笑? 咬东西? 所以，梦到牙齿跟你的自信和坚定程度有很大关系! 梦到牙齿脱落，暗指你的自信心被打击了!<br>梦到自己长出吸血鬼牙齿，说明你在依靠别人来获取自信。<p>You should be more confident in whatever situation is challenging you.<br>Rather than seeing the unknown as a threat,relish it as a challenge.<br>面对困境，自信一点吧! 虽然未知很可怕，但当作挑战来enjoy一下也是不错的。<p>【梦境三：找不到厕所怎么办?】<br>YOU CAN&#39;T FIND A LOO<p>You are desperate for the toilet. The only ones you can find are in<br>strange places or in public view. You might find yourself in a queue<br>and when you finally get there, the toilet is unusable.<br>急啊，就是找不到厕所怎么办? 或者找到的厕所全是在那些奇奇怪怪的地方，有的甚至在公共场合！？即使找到厕所，不是队排得老长，就是根本不能用(坑爹啊)。<p>*解梦*<br>You have a need you are unable to express. Queuing means you hope your<br>needs will be met if you look after other people&#39;s wants. But the best<br>way to resolve this situation is to put yourself first. This may seem<br>selfish, but it is much easier to look after other people&#39;s needs when<br>you attend your own.<br>这说明你内心深处有不能表达的欲望。排队意味着你有着这样的期望：如果先满足了别人的需要，自己也会得到满足。但解决问题的最好办法，就是把自己放在第一位。这样听起来有点自私，但其实当你努力实现了自己的愿望时，满足别人的需求也会变得容易的多。<p>【梦境4：发现自己在街上一丝不挂?】<br>YOU&#39;RE NAKED IN PUBLIC<p>You are surprised to find yourself naked in a public place and are<br>making frantic attempts to shield your body. Everyone else is fully<br>dressed but they don&#39;t seem to notice your condition.<br>你惊讶地发现自己在公共场合一丝不挂，并且发了疯似的想要遮掩自己的身体。与此同时，其他人都衣着整齐，而且貌似没有注意到你有任何异常。<p>*解梦*<br>You feel vulnerable and exposed, perhaps in a new job or relationship.<br>No one sees your nakedness because you seem secure and confident to<br>them. The dream usually indicates a positive and healthy progression<br>in our lives, as we are being invited to step into unfamiliar<br>territory and display our talents. It might be nerve-racking, but<br>express your true self without thinking about how people are judging<br>you.<br>这说明你对于眼前的新工作或新恋情，感到脆弱无助。周遭人士对你的裸体毫不在意，说明在他们眼中，你足够强大自信。这种梦境其实暗示你目前状态不错，尤其是到了新环境要施展才华的时候。虽然这很让人伤脑筋，但是抛弃世俗的眼光，勇敢地表现你自己吧!<p>【梦境5：这是考哪门子试?】<br>YOU&#39;RE UNPREPARED FOR AN EXAM<p>You are sitting an important exam but are shocked to realize you have<br>done no studying. It&#39;s too late to do anything and you are<br>disappointed.<br>梦见自己坐在考场里参加一场重要考试，但面对考卷却脑袋空空，大惊失色。但为时已晚，追悔莫及。<p>*解梦*<br>Your lack of preparation shows you usually prepare meticulously for<br>every task. You set yourself high standards and feel a constant<br>anxiety that you will end up with a poor result. But it&#39;s not others<br>that are judging - it&#39;s you.<br>这其实暗示了你在做任何事情时都准备得事无巨细。你对自己高标准要求，常常感到焦虑，害怕自己最后搞砸。其实根本没有人会说三道四，是你自己放不开。<p>When you judge yourself too harshly, you will feel like a failure, no<br>matter how successful you are. The best way to move on from this dream<br>is to consider what makes you happiest and most fulfilled in life.<p>【梦境6: 咦? 我怎么飞起来了?】<br>YOU&#39;RE FLYING<p>First you have the sensation of floating, then you soar into the sky<br>and fly through the air. You have a tremendous feeling of<br>exhilaration.<br>你感觉自己飘起来了，然后直冲云霄，享受畅游在空中的感觉。是不是觉得很爽呢?<p>*解梦*<br>You have been released from circumstances that were weighing you down.<br>You are free of constraints, making you feel &quot;as free as a bird&quot;.<br>Although you may regard this feeling of liberation as luck, you<br>created the opportunity yourself. Consider other chances in your life<br>where you could go off into the realms of new possibilities.<br>这暗示你刚刚从很郁闷的状态中解脱出来。现在的你无拘无束，就像一只自由的小鸟。或许你把这一切归功于运气好。但这自由，却是你亲手创造出来的。尝试一下其它机会吧，说不定在别的领域又是一番新天地呢。<p>【梦境7：失重跌倒或摔下去】<br>YOU&#39;RE FALLING<p>Everything seems normal, but then you suddenly feel your legs give way<br>as you stumble and fall. Sometimes the fall is minor, other times you<br>tumble downstairs or plummet off a cliff into a chasm.<br>周遭一切都看起来很正常，但突然自己腿一软就一头栽了下去。这还算轻的，有时甚至是从楼上摔下去，甚至从悬崖摔落到山间裂缝中。<p>*解梦*<br>This signifies a fear of losing control. Falling suggests you need to<br>let go of responsibilities that are dragging you down. This dream is<br>often triggered by stress and so is encouraging you to take a more<br>relaxed approach in certain areas of your life. Try relaxing your<br>muscles before going to bed.<br>这映射了你对失去控制的恐惧。是不是身上的担子太重了才会让你如此不堪?<br>如果梦境中出现类似情况，大多是因为压力引起，所以还是没有必要把自己逼太紧! 试着在睡觉之前放松下肌肉吧。<p>【梦境8：车失去控制，怎么办?】<br>YOU&#39;RE IN AN OUT-OF-CONTROL VEHICLE<p>You are in a vehicle that is spinning out of control. You desperately<br>try to slow down because you are scared of crashing.<br>疾驶在路上的车失去了控制! 你发了疯的想减速，谁也不想撞车!<p>*解梦*<br>You&#39;re thinking about the path you are taking in life, usually in your<br>career. An imminent crash shows you are going to be in contact or<br>conflict with something unavoidable. Rather than abandoning your<br>present position, consider the areas where you do have control. Don&#39;t<br>be afraid to ask others for help; they can help you get back into the<br>driver&#39;s seat. Accept there are some situations over which you have no<br>control.<br>这说明你在重新权衡你现在选择的道路，通常是事业上的选择。即将发生的车祸暗指你马上会跟不能避免的情况打交道，甚至产生冲突。先不要放弃你目前的选择，看看周遭还有什么是在你控制之下的。困难当头，应该及时向他人求救，他们可以帮你步入正轨。记住，人不可能一切尽在掌握，接受现实吧。<p>【梦境9：发现神秘房间】<br>YOU DISCOVER AN UNUSED ROOM<p>You are walking through your house when you notice a door you haven&#39;t<br>seen before. You open it to find a room you had completely forgotten<br>about.<br>你在自己的房子里游荡，突然发现一扇从未见过的门。打开门看到的房间让你一点印象都没有。<p>*解梦*<br>Homes in dreams symbolize ourselves and different rooms are aspects of<br>our character. The unnoticed door indicates you have a chance to step<br>into an exciting new possibility. The size of the room reflects the<br>size of the chance. You might think you know your achievements and<br>limitations, but you have talents you have yet to discover. Be open to<br>even the most unexpected opportunities.<br>梦里的家就是我们自己，而不同的房间则代表我们个性的不同方面。一扇你从未见过的门暗示你将有机会踏入崭新的领域。房间大小不同，机遇大小也不同。也许你知道自己这么多年的得失是什么，但你身上还有尚待挖掘的闪光点。即使是最不可能的机会，也不要轻易放过！<p>【梦境10：梦见自己迟到了!】<br>YOU&#39;RE LATE<p>You are on your way to an appointment and realize you are late. You<br>keep looking at the clock and are alarmed at time passing. You feel as<br>if you&#39;ll never get where you need to be.<br>在赴约的路上，你发现自己迟到了。你不断看表，但时间过得飞快，你感觉似乎永远也到达不了目的地。<p>*解梦*<br>You are worried you are missing an opportunity and that time is<br>running out to carry out a plan, such as starting a family or<br>achieving a career goal. Commit to meaningful action rather than<br>involving yourself in meaningless action. Once a decision has been<br>made, your direction will become clear and your time becomes your own,<br>rather than being subject to the whims of what is happening around<br>you.<br>你担心自己错过某个机会，或者执行某个计划的时间不够了，比如组建家庭或达到某个事业上的目标。还是把心思放在有意义的行动上吧，别做无用功了。一旦做出决定，方向也就明确，时间也就完全变成你自己的了。千万不要把时间花在那些有的没的上面。</div>
