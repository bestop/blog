Time Well Spent   
See tiny fingers and tiny toes,    
Bright baby eyes, cute baby nose;    
Hear baby gurgles and baby sighs,   
As Mom and Dad sing lullabies.   
Life is changed, but that's okay;    
It's fun to spend glad hours each day,   
Taking time for all the good,   
That comes along with parenthood.
