But what can our   obsession with plants teach us about our own personal journeys?</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>My aunts, mom and grandma always talk about their plants   when they get together. They trade cuttings, smuggling them over state lines to   propagate at home.[2] They discuss their plants like children or pets. They   share tips. Compare progress.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>We turn plants into sentimental[3] objects as we do with   books and art, but with plants it's different because they're alive. They grow   and change. You see photographs of your former apartment, and there's that peace   lily, half its present size. It's like looking at old family pictures: "Look how   little you used to be!" Plants have a history and a life. That's why they're so   hard to give up, even when you don't love them anymore, even when you don't have   room for them. What are you supposed to do, just let them die?   Impossible.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>When I had to move everything out of my house recently, I   realized there were more little plants than I was willing to find places for in   my new cramped quarters.[4] I thought, it's silly to be sentimental about these   plants. I can replace them later if I want. Yet I just couldn't give up the   succulent[5] I kept alive during my first year of teaching.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>It sat on top of a microwave, in a tiny, dark, cold office   space that was really a storage closet with a window. During the times I thought   I might lose my mind, I watched the plant's health. It refused to wither. It   stood hardy and strong, and occasionally sprung a tender new leaf. Sometimes I   would forget to water it or take it home during vacations, but it withstood this   neglect and stubbornly lived on. This buoyed[6] my spirit more than chocolate or   pats on the back.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>Our adopted foliage can serve as a sort of bellwether for   our lives.[7] Most of us have gone through periods where we let the phone ring,   the dishes pile up, and the houseplants shrivel.[8] Eventually, the pile of   brittle leaves collecting beneath the ficus forces us to assess the state of our   lives.[9]</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>Of course, because we have sentimentalized our plants, it's   tempting to read their lives for clues to our own. Once, when a relationship was   dying, my African violet exploded with unseasonable purple flowers.[10] Maybe, I   thought, there's hope. There was―for the violet.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>My stepmom visits a particular hemlock[11] in a park near   her home every New Year's Day. She walks circles around its trunk, one hand on   the bark[12], releasing regrets from the old year and planning for the new one.   Her own history and life is now intertwined with the hemlock's, as year after   year, the tree receives her hopes and ushers them forth with fresh oxygen.[13]   "Here you go," it says. "Here's some more life."</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>1. 植物总是孜孜不倦地汲取水分和阳光的种种滋养。</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>2. 她们跨越州界交换植物的插条，让它们在自己家里生根发芽。cutting:   插条，是从母株上截取的枝条，在适当条件下可培育出新的植株；smuggle: 偷运，走私；propagate: 繁衍。</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>3. sentimental:   寓有情感的，感情用事的，下文的sentimentalize指"为……而伤感"。</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>4. cramped: 狭小的；quarters:（常用作复数）住处。</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>5. succulent: 多肉植物。</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>6. buoy: 鼓励，振奋……的精神。</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>7. adopt: 收养；foliage: [总称] 叶，此处指观叶植物；bellwether:   楷模。</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>8. houseplant: 室内植物；shrivel: 枯萎。</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>9. brittle: 易碎的，此处指落叶干枯后易碎的状态；ficus:   热带榕属植物，其中某些种类为常见的室内植物。</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>10.
