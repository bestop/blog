  <div><DIV>  <DIV class=sanjineiwen>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -2.2pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>When I was   a kid, I remember my dad used to sing an old, WWI song, "Pack up your Troubles,"   while he was getting dressed for work in the morning. The lyrics from the chorus   of the song play in my head often when I'm packing for a trip―"Pack up your   troubles in your old kit bag and smile, smile, smile."</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -2.2pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Lately,   with TSA regulations seemingly changing daily, packing my kit bag with clothes,   toothbrush and Ziploc-baggie of three-ounce bottles seems more like trouble than   fun, fun, fun.</FONT></P>  <P align=right><FONT face=Arial><IMG style="WIDTH: 254px; HEIGHT: 193px"   id=1263470 title="" border=0 alt="Pack up your loved ones 带上至亲至爱" align=right   src="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/language_tips/book/attachement/jpg/site1/20090330/0013729e41a90b3aa5c801.jpg"   zmxid="zoomXimageId6" md5="" sourcedescription="编辑提供的本地文件"   sourcename="本地文件"></FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -2.2pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>For my   friend, Vikki, though, what to pack isn't as important as whom to pack. She   takes her family and friends everywhere. Vikki took her mother skiing in Mammoth   last November and she took my mother-in-law to the ruins of Machu Picchu and   Rome. Vikki has taken numerous people to exotic places like the outback in   Australia, and the Greek Islands―all posthumously and in her bag.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -2.2pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>You see,   Vikki collects prayer cards from funerals and memorials of her loved ones and   takes them with her wherever she goes. The cards, some with watercolor images of   Jesus and others with pictures of a deceased friend and "in loving memory"   printed beneath, are bound together with a rubber band and stashed somewhere in   Vikki's carry-on.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -2.2pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>I'm   fascinated by this practice and ask her about it often. I like to keep tabs on   the number of cards she carries as it increases. At last count Vikki was toting   around forty people. I've often thought that when the tally reached fifty-two,   I'd propose some kind of card game we could play. My husband, Larry and I   sometimes travel with Vikki and her husband, Bill, so we could while away the   hours on trains and boats by playing some modified version of war, poker, or   go-fish.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -2.2pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Obviously,   I'm not as sentimental about Vikki's collection as she is, but on a trip two   years ago, I witnessed the power of those prayer cards.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -2.2pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Larry and   I were in Peru with Vikki and Bill. We had just finished dinner at a restaurant   in Aguas Calientes, when Vikki slid a small card across the table to Larry and   asked, "Would you like to have your mom with you tomorrow when you climb Machu   Picchu?" Larry was visibly moved by the gesture and slipped the prayer card from   his mother's funeral into his shirt pocket. When we walked the ancient, Incan   ruins the next day, Larry had his mom with him and I could sense the joy he felt   in her presence.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -2.2pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>It was   then I realized the enormous happiness Vikki must feel, having some forty loved   ones near her at all times.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -2.2pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>With all   the rules today about what travelers can't bring on a flight, maybe we'd all be   a little more pleasant if we focused on the things we can bring and make sure   they are what make us happy or at least smile, smile,   smile.</FONT></P></DIV></DIV></div>
