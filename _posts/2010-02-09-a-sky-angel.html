  <div><DIV>  <DIV class=sanjineiwen>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>In 1978, I became a flight   attendant for a major airline. Earning my wings was the culmination of a   childhood dream that I had set for myself after my first plane ride at the age   of five. Like so many others before me, I fell in love with the romance of   airplanes, adventure and helping others.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>I have flown hundreds of   flights since graduation, but one stands out among the many.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>We were flying from Los Angeles   to Washington, D.C, when I answered a lavatory call light in the coach cabin.   There I found a young mother struggling with her infant. Everything was a mess,   to say the least, and the mother, who was near hysterics, told me she had no   more diapers or other clothing onboard the aircraft.</FONT></P>  <P align=right><FONT face=Arial><IMG style="WIDTH: 200px; HEIGHT: 169px"   id=1042419 title="" border=0 alt="A Sky Angel" align=right   src="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/language_tips/book/attachement/jpg/site1/20081017/0013729e42d20a627f020c.jpg"   md5="" sourcedescription="编辑提供的本地文件" sourcename="本地文件"></FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial></FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Through her tears, she informed   me that they had missed their flight the previous night in Los Angeles and   because she had very little money, she and her son had spent the night on the   airport floor. Since she hadn't expected to miss the flight, she was forced to   use up most of her supplies and whatever money she had to feed them.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>With the saddest eyes I have   ever seen she continued. She told me she was on her way to New Hampshire to   deliver her son to the family that was adopting him. She could no longer support   the two of them.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>As she stood in front of me,   crying, holding her beautiful son, I could see the despair and hopelessness on   her face. And, as a mother of three beautiful daughters, I could feel her   pain.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>I immediately rang the flight   attendant call button and asked for assistance from the other flight attendants.   They brought cloth towels from first class to assist in cleaning up both mom and   the infant. I ran and got my suitcase; because this woman and I were about the   same size, I gave her a sweater and a pair of pants I had brought for my   layover. Then I asked several families if they could spare extra diapers,   formula and clothes for the child. After the young mother and her son had   changed their clothes and the baby had gone to sleep, I sat with her, holding   her hand, trying to provide some support and comfort for the remainder of the   flight.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Once we landed, I walked them   to their next flight, which would take them to their final destination;   separation. I briefed the gate agent and the new flight attendant crew on the   situation and asked them to give her special attention.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>With tears in my eyes I gave   her a hug and told her, "You have shown me the true meaning of courage and a   mother's love. I will never forget you."</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>As she thanked me for all I had   done she said softly, "You're not the flight attendant, you're a sky angel."   Touching my flight attendant wings, she continued, "And those are your angel   wings."</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>With those words she turned and   walked down the jetway, her child in her arms, and boarded the plane for New   Hampshire.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Though I am no longer a flight   attendant, my "angel wings" are still on prominent display in my office. And   each time I see them, I am reminded of that young woman, her infant son and the   gift that she gave me on that special day - that we truly are all spiritual   beings traveling in human form.</FONT></P></DIV></DIV></div>
