While his outsize films push   the bounds of technology, they're always anchored in human stories with heart   and soul.</FONT></DIV>  <DIV><FONT face=Arial>James Cameron has written and directed some of the largest   blockbuster movies of the last 20 years, including <EM>The Terminator, Aliens,   The Abyss, Terminator 2: Judgment Day, Titanic,</EM> and <EM>Avatar</EM>. His   films&nbsp; pushed the limits of special effects, and his fascination with   technical developments led him to co-create the 3-D Fusion Camera System. He has   also contributed to new techniques in underwater filming and remote vehicle   technology. <BR><BR>Although now a major filmmaker, Cameron's first job was as a   truck driver and he wrote only in his spare time. After seeing<EM> Star   Wars</EM>, he quit that job and wrote his first science fiction script for a   ten-minute short called Xenogenesis. Soon after, he began working with special   effects, and by 1984 he had written and directed the movie that would change his   life -- <EM>The Terminator.</EM>&nbsp; Today, he has received three Academy   Awards, two honorary doctorates and sits on the NASA Advisory   Council.&nbsp;</FONT></DIV>  <DIV><FONT face=Arial></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV><FONT face=Arial>What we can get from this speech? Curiosity,imagination   and fearless to failure&nbsp;are very important to success. Failure is not an   option, but the more important is&nbsp;what we can learn   from&nbsp;it.&nbsp;</FONT></DIV></div>
