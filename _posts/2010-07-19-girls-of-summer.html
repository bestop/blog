  <div><DIV>  <DIV class=sanjineiwen>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>We lived on   the banks of the Tennessee River, and we owned the summers when we were girls.   We ran wild through humid summer days that never ended but only melted one into   the other. We floated down rivers of weekdays with no school, no rules , no   parents, and no constructs other than our fantasies. We were good girls, my   sister and I. We had nothing to rebel against. This was just life as we knew it,   and we knew the summers to be long and to be ours.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>The road   that ran past our house was a one-lane rural route. Every morning, after our   parents had gone to work, I'd wait for the mail lady to pull up to our box. Some   days I would put enough change for a few stamps into a mason jar lid and leave   it in the mailbox. I hated bothering mail lady with this transaction, which made   her job take longer. But I liked that she knew that someone in our house sent   letters into the outside world.</FONT></P>  <P align=center><FONT face=Arial></FONT>  <DIV align=left><FONT face=Arial><IMG style="WIDTH: 433px; HEIGHT: 219px"   id=2072576 title="" border=0 alt="Girls of summer 夏日女孩" align=center   src="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/language_tips/book/attachement/jpg/site1/20091221/0013729e41a90c9935a904.jpg"   md5="" sourcedescription="编辑提供的本地文件" sourcename="本地文件"></FONT></DIV>  <P><FONT face=Arial></FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>I liked   walking to the mailbox in my bare feet and leaving footprints on the dewy grass.   I imagined that feeling the wetness on the bottom of my feet made me a poet. I   had never read poetry, outside of some Emily Dickinson. But I imagined that   people who knew of such things would walk to their mailboxes through the morning   dew in their bare feet.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>We planned   our weddings with the help of Barbie dolls and the tiny purple wild flowers   growing in our side yard. We became scientists and tested concoctions of milk,   orange juice, and mouthwash. We ate handfuls of bittersweet chocolate chips and   licked peanut butter off spoons. When we ran out of sweets to eat, we snitched   sugary Flintstones vitamins out of the medicine cabinet. We became masters of   the Kraft macaroni and cheese lunch, and we dutifully called our mother at work   three times a day to give her updates on our adventures. But don't call too   often or speak too loudly or whine too much, we told ourselves, or else they'll   get annoyed and she'll get fired and the summers will end.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>We shaped   our days the way we chose, far from the prying eyes of adults. We found our   dad's Playboys and charged the neighborhood boys money to look at them. We made   crank calls around the county, telling people they had won a new car. "What   kind?" they'd ask. "Red," we'd always say. We put on our mom's old prom dresses,   complete with gloves and hats, and sang backup to the C.W. McCall song convoy, "   which we'd found on our dad's turntable.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>We went on   hikes into the woods behind our house, crawling under barbed wire fences and   through tangled undergrowth. Heat and humidity found their way throught he   leaves to our flushed faces. We waded in streams that we were always surprised   to come across. We walked past cars and auto parts that had been abandoned in   the woods, far from any road. We'd reach the tree line and come out unexpectedly   into a cow pasture. We''d perch on the gate or stretch out on the large flat   limes tone outcrop that marked the end of the Woods Behind Our House.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>One day a   thunderstorm blew up along the Tennessee River. It was one of those storms that   make the day go dark and the humidity disappear. First it was still and quiet.   There was electricity in the air and then the sharp crispness of a summer day   being blown wide open as the winds rushed in. We threw open all the doors and   windows. We found the classical radio station from two towns away and turned up   the bass and cranked up the speakers. We let the wind blow in and churn our   summer day around. We let the music we were only vaguely familiar with roar   through the house. And we twirled. We twirled in the living room in the wind and   in the music. We twirled and we imagined that we were poets and dancers and   scientists and spring brides.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>We twirled   and imagined that if we could let everything --- the thunder, the storm, the   wind , the world --- into that house in the banks of the Tennessee River, we   could live in our summer dreams forever. When we were   girls.</FONT></P></DIV></DIV></div>
