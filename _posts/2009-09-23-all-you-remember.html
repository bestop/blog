  <div><DIV class=3jbiaoti>All you remember about your child being an infant is the   incredible awe you felt about the precious miracle you created. You remember   having plenty of time to bestow all your wisdom and knowledge. You thought your   child would take all of your advice and make fewer mistakes, and be much smarter   than you were. You wished for your child to hurry and grow up.</DIV>  <DIV class=3jineiwen>  <P>All you remember about your child being two is never using the restroom alone   or getting to watch a movie without talking animals. You recall afternoons   talking on the phone while crouching in the bedroom closet, and being convinced   your child would be the first Ivy League1 college student to graduate wearing   pullovers at the ceremony. You remember worrying about the bag of M＆M's melting   in your pocket and ruining your good dress. You wished for your child to be more   independent.</P>  <P>All you remember about your child being five is the first day of school and   finally having the house to yourself. You remember joining the PTA and being   elected president when you left a meeting to use the restroom. You remember   being asked "Is Santa real?" and saying "yes" because he had to be for a little   bit longer. You remember shaking the sofa cushions for loose change, so the   toothfairy could come and take away your child's first lost tooth. You wished   for your child to have all permanent teeth.</P>  <P>All you remember about your child being seven is the carpool schedule. You   learned to apply makeup in two minutes and brush your teeth in the rearview   mirror because the only time you had to yourself was when you were stopped at   red lights. You considered painting your car yellow and posting a "taxi" sign on   the lawn next to the garage door. You remember people staring at you, the few   times you were out of the car, because you kept flexing your foot and making   acceleration noises. You wished for the day your child would learn how to   drive.</P>  <P>All you remember about your child being ten is managing the school   fund�raisers. You sold wrapping paper for paint, T shirts for new furniture, and   magazine subscriptions for shade trees in the school playground. You remember   storing a hundred cases of candy bars in the garage to sell so the school band   could get new uniforms, and how they melted together on an unseasonably5 warm   spring afternoon. You wished your child would grow out of playing an   instrument.<BR><BR>All you remember about your child being twelve is sitting in   the stands during baseball practice and hoping your child's team would strike   out fast because you had more important things to do at home. The coach didn't   understand how busy you were. You wished the baseball season would be over   soon.</P>  <P>All you remember about your child being fourteen is being asked not to stop   the car in front of the school in the morning. You had to drive two blocks   further and unlock the doors without coming to a complete stop. You remember not   getting to kiss your child goodbye or talking to him in front of his friends.   You wished your child would be more mature.</P>  <P>All you remember about your child being sixteen is loud music and   undecipherable lyrics screamed to a rhythmic beat. You wished for your child to   grow up and leave home with the stereo.</P>  <P>All you remember about your child being eighteen is the day they were born   and having all the time in the world.</P>  <P>And, as you walk through your quiet house, you wonder where they went and you   wish your child hadn't grown up so fast.</P></DIV>  <DIV><FONT size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV></div>
