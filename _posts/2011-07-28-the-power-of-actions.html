  <div><DIV>  <DIV class=sanjiriqi><FONT face=Arial>One day, when I was a freshman in high   school, I saw a kid from my class walking home from school. His name was Kyle.   It looked like he was carrying all of his books. I thought to myself, "Why would   anyone bring home all his books on a Friday? He must really be a nerd." I had   quite a weekend planned (parties and a football game with my friend the   following afternoon), so I shrugged my shoulders and went on.</FONT></DIV>  <DIV class=sanjineiwen>  <P><FONT face=Arial>As I was walking, I saw a bunch of kids running toward him.   They ran at him, knocking all his books out of his arms and tripping him so he   landed in the dirt. His glasses went flying, and I saw them land in the grass   about ten feet from him. He looked up and I saw this terrible sadness in his   eyes.</FONT></P>  <P align=right><FONT face=Arial><IMG style="WIDTH: 300px; HEIGHT: 208px"   id=3757043 title="" border=0 alt=不要吝惜你的帮助 align=right   src="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/language_tips/book/attachement/jpg/site1/20110429/0023ae731d750f24742c30.jpg"   md5="" sourcedescription="编辑提供的本地文件" sourcename="本地文件"></FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>My heart went out to him. So, I jogged over to him, and as   he crawled around looking for his glasses, I saw tears in his eyes. I handed him   his glasses and said, "Those guys are jerks. They really should get lives." He   looked at me and said, "Hey, thanks!" There was a big smile on his face. It was   one of those smiles that showed real gratitude. I helped him pick up his books,   and asked him where he lived. It turned out he lived near me, so I asked him why   I had never seen him before. He said he had gone to private school before coming   to this school.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>I would have never hung out with a private school kid   before. We talked all the way home, and I carried his books. He turned out to be   a pretty cool kid. I asked him if he wanted to play football on Saturday with me   and my friends. He said yes. We hung all weekend and the more I got to know   Kyle, the more I liked him. And my friends thought the same of him. Monday   morning came, and there was Kyle with the huge stack of books again. I stopped   him and said, "Damn boy, you are gonna really build some serious muscles with   this pile of books everyday!". He just laughed and handed me half the books.   Over the next four years, Kyle and I became best friends.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>When we were seniors, we began to think about college. Kyle   decided on Georgetown, and I was going to Duke. I knew that we would always be   friends, that the miles would never be a problem. He was going to be a doctor,   and I was going for business on a football scholarship. Kyle was valedictorian   of our class.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>I teased him all the time about being a nerd. He had to   prepare a speech for graduation. I was so glad it wasn't me having to get up   there and speak.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>Graduation day arrived&nbsp;-- I saw Kyle and he looked   great. He was one of those guys that really found himself during high school. He   filled out and actually looked good in glasses. He had more dates than me and   all the girls loved him!</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>Boy, sometimes I was jealous. Today was one of those days. I   could see that he was nervous about his speech. So, I smacked him on the back   and said, "Hey, big guy, you'll be great!"</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>He looked at me with one of those looks (the really grateful   one) and smiled. "Thanks," he said. As he started his speech, he cleared his   throat, and began. "Graduation is a time to thank those who helped you make it   through those tough years. Your parents, your teachers, your siblings, maybe a   coach… but mostly your friends. I am here to tell all of you that being a friend   to someone is the best gift you can give them. I am going to tell you a   story."</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>I stared at my friend in disbelief as he told the story of   the first day we met. He had planned to kill himself over the weekend. He talked   of how he had cleaned out his locker so his Mom wouldn't have to do it later and   was carrying his stuff home. He looked hard at me and gave me a little smile.   "Thankfully, I was saved. My friend saved me from doing the   unspeakable."</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>I heard the gasp go through the crowd as this handsome,   popular boy told us all about his weakest moment. I saw his mom and dad looking   at me and smiling that same grateful smile. Not until that moment did I realize   its depth.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>Never underestimate the power of your actions. With one   small gesture you can change a person's life. For better or for worse. God puts   us all in each other's lives to impact one another in some way. Look for God in   others.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>"Friends are angels who lift us to our feet when our wings   have trouble remembering how to fly."</FONT></P></DIV></DIV></div>
