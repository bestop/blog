You remember having plenty of time to bestow   all your wisdom and knowledge. You thought your child would take all of your   advice and make fewer mistakes, and be much smarter than you were. You wished   for your child to hurry and grow up.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>All you   remember about your child being two is never using the restroom alone or getting   to watch a movie without talking animals. You recall afternoons talking on the   phone while crouching in the bedroom closet, and being convinced your child   would be the first Ivy League college student to graduate wearing pullovers at   the ceremony. You remember worrying about the bag of M＆M's melting in your   pocket and ruining your good dress. You wished for your child to be more   independent.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>All you   remember about your child being five is the first day of school and finally   having the house to yourself. You remember joining the PTA and being elected   president when you left a meeting to use the restroom. You remember being asked   "Is Santa real?" and saying "yes" because he had to be for a little bit longer.   You remember shaking the sofa cushions for loose change, so the toothfairy could   come and take away your child's first lost tooth. You wished for your child to   have all permanent teeth.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>All you   remember about your child being seven is the carpool schedule. You learned to   apply makeup in two minutes and brush your teeth in the rearview mirror because   the only time you had to yourself was when you were stopped at red lights. You   considered painting your car yellow and posting a "taxi" sign on the lawn next   to the garage door. You remember people staring at you, the few times you were   out of the car, because you kept flexing your foot and making acceleration   noises. You wished for the day your child would learn how to drive.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>All you   remember about your child being ten is managing the school fund�raisers. You   sold wrapping paper for paint, T�shirts for new furniture, and magazine   subscriptions for shade trees in the school playground. You remember storing a   hundred cases of candy bars in the garage to sell so the school band could get   new uniforms, and how they melted together on an unseasonably warm spring   afternoon. You wished your child would grow out of playing an   instrument.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>All you   remember about your child being twelve is sitting in the stands during baseball   practice and hoping your child's team would strike out fast because you had more   important things to do at home. The coach didn't understand how busy you were.   You wished the baseball season would be over soon.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>All you   remember about your child being fourteen is being asked not to stop the car in   front of the school in the morning. You had to drive two blocks further and   unlock the doors without coming to a complete stop. You remember not getting to   kiss your child goodbye or talking to him in front of his friends. You wished   your child would be more mature.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>All you   remember about your child being sixteen is loud music and undecipherable lyrics   screamed to a rhythmic beat. You wished for your child to grow up and leave home   with the stereo.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>All you   remember about your child being eighteen is the day they were born and having   all the time in the world.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>And, as you   walk through your quiet house, you wonder where they went and you wish your   child hadn't grown up so fast.</FONT></P></DIV></DIV></div>
