  <div><DIV>  <DIV class=sanjiriqi><FONT face=Arial>Horror gripped the heart of the World War   I soldier as he saw his lifelong friend fall in battle. Caught in a trench with   continuous gunfire whizzing over his head, the soldier asked his lieutenant if   he might go out into the "No Man's Land" between the trenches to bring his   fallen comrade back.</FONT></DIV>  <DIV class=sanjineiwen>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"You can go," said the   Lieutenant, "but I don't think it will be worth it. Your friend is probably dead   and you may throw your own life away." The Lieutenant's words didn't matter, and   the soldier went anyway.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Miraculously he managed to   reach his friend, hoisted him onto his shoulder, and brought him back to their   company's trench. As the two of them tumbled in together to the bottom of the   trench, the officer checked the wounded soldier, then looked kindly at his   friend. "I told you it wouldn't be worth it," he said. "Your friend is dead, and   you are mortally wounded."</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"It was worth it, though, sir,"   the soldier said.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"How do you mean 'worth it'?"   responded the Lieutenant. "Your friend is dead!"</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"Yes sir," the private   answered. "But it was worth it because when I got to him, he was still alive,   and I had the satisfaction of hearing him say, 'Jim, I knew you'd   come.'"</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Many a time in life, whether a   thing is worth doing or not really depends on how you look at it.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Take up all your courage and do   something your heart tells you to do so that you may not regret not doing it   later in life.</FONT></P></DIV></DIV></div>
