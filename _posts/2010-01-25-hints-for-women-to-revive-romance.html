When he is performing a   thoughtful gesture on your behalf, don't complain about the quality of his   actions. Simply express your appreciation (then fix it later!).</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>3. Serve him breakfast in bed   (without causing food poisoning).</FONT></P>  <P align=center><FONT face=Arial></FONT></P>  <P align=right><FONT face=Arial><IMG style="WIDTH: 200px; HEIGHT: 250px"   id=902436 title="" border=0 hspace=0 alt="Hints for Women to Revive Romance"   align=right   src="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/language_tips/book/attachement/jpg/site1/20080721/0013729e42d209ee47410e.jpg"   width=200 height=250 zmxid="zoomXimageId6" md5="" sourcedescription="编辑提供的本地文件"   sourcename="本地文件"></FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial></FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>4. Give him a massage or   arrange for him to visit to a professional masseuse.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>5. Throw him a surprise party   for no particular reason. Invite people he enjoys.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>6. Take him out for a romantic   dinner for two. Bring two gifts. One for him. One he (indirectly) bought for   you! He'll be pleased he didn't mess yours up this time!</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>7. There is a law of nature   that plucks a man's change from his pocket without his knowledge. Over time,   collect these "donations," wrap them, roll them, and present the cash to him for   a purchase that he didn't believe he had the finances to make.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>8. Place hidden notes (or   jokes) in his lunch, briefcase, grooming area, underwear or sock drawer which   express how much you love him.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>9. Recreate your first date   ever. Cover as many of the intricate details as possible.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>10. Arrange for him to take a   private lesson in his favorite sport or hobby.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>11. Buy him a sleeve of   exploding golf balls. You might not be present at the precise moment they're   enjoyed, but I guarantee he'll express his thanks later.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>12. Suggest a role reversal   day. You perform all of his chores and vice versa. I'm not sure that he'll find   this romantic, but he will never again complain about his   responsibilities.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>13. Finally, let him complete a   sentence. He'll appreciate the change of   pace.</FONT></P></DIV></DIV></div>
