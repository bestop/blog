There are   many factors which can affect your choice, and there are many people who have   discovered how to achieve a healthy work life balance that allows them to have   both.</FONT></DIV>  <DIV class=sanjineiwen>  <P align=right><FONT face=Arial><IMG style="WIDTH: 245px; HEIGHT: 296px"   id=810003 title="" border=0 alt="Choosing a career over love" align=right   src="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/language_tips/book/attachement/jpg/site1/20080428/0013729e42d2097fb84814.jpg"   md5="" sourcedescription="编辑提供的本地文件" sourcename="本地文件"></FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial></FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Careers and love fulfill us in   different but important ways. Having a solid career gives us a sense of   accomplishment and self worth, aside from the practicalities of paying the   bills. Many people develop their entire identity based upon what they do,   elevating their career to a level of great importance in their lives.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Then there are those who   measure their success in terms of having a pleasant and rewarding Home life.   They develop their identities based upon the accomplishments of their children,   and derive their self worth through the love and support of a spouse.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>So what happens if you cannot   or do not wish to make room in your life for both? While the happiest and   healthiest people have managed to develop a work life balance that allows for   both, it may not be for everyone. Consider these factors when pondering which is   more important for you.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>1. Your career May be More   Important When You are Young</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Many people these days focus on   careers first and family later. The reasoning is that, while you are young and   unencumbered, you have the time and energy to fully devote yourself to a career.   If you have lofty career ambitions while you are young, it may indeed be the   time to start making progress towards those goals.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Once you get married and begin   to build a family, much of your time and energy � by necessity � becomes devoted   to your family. This is as it should be. You should not start a family unless   you are willing to devote time and attention to your loved ones.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Many people who accomplish   great success in their careers when they are young, and establish themselves in   a secure position, are then more willing and comfortable later on to devote   themselves to family. By the time they do settle down, they are more prepared to   handle the responsibility.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>2. Falling in Love can be   Better When You are Older</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>More and more people these days   are choosing to wait when it comes to making decisions about family. It is not   unusual for people to delay marriage until their late 30's or even their early   40's. Delaying family decisions allows you to be better prepared for those   obligations, and creates a better likelihood that you are in touch with your   most important goals and values. You have had the opportunity to completely grow   up, greatly reducing the chances of feeling like you are "missing out." You have   had the chance to purge the foolishness of youth from your system and are now   confident with the wisdom of maturity.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>3. Choosing Both If you can   find a work life balance that allows you to experience the joys of love and   maintain a successful career, you will have a truly happy and rewarding life. A   loving family at Home can help you celebrate all of your successes, and bolster   your confidence through your failures. There are many people out there reaping   the tremendous rewards that come with including love and work in their lives,   and finding the balance that allows for both.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>A life that only has room for a   career, or that includes a consuming love that stifles your personal   development, is likely not a lifestyle that is healthy or fulfilling. Our   personal needs and feelings of self worth need to be met, which is normally   gained from having a good career. Our hearts and souls need to be nourished, and   we need companionship to support us through life, which normally are derived   from loving relationships.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>The truly healthy and well   balanced person will recognize the benefits of having both. He or she will take   steps to achieve the work life balance necessary to assure the continuation of   career growth while nurturing and maintaining the health of personal   relationships. It is only when we can maintain this delicate balance that we are   living life to its greatest potential.</FONT></P></DIV></DIV></div>
