  <div><DIV><FONT face=宋体 size=2>  <P>"Everything happens for the best," my mother said whenever I faced   disappointment. "If you carry on, one day something good will happen. And you'll   realize that it wouldn't have happened if not for that previous disappointment.   "</P>  <P>Mother was right, as I discovered after graduating from college in 1932, I   had decided to try for a job in radio, then work my way up to sports announcer.   I hitchhiked to Chicago and knocked on the door of every station--and got turned   down every time.</P>  <P>In one studio, a kind lady told me that big stations couldn't risk hiring an   inexperienced person. "Go out in the sticks and find a small station that'll   give you a chance, " she said. I thumbed home to Dixon, Illinois.</P>  <P>While there were no radio－announcing jobs in Dixon, my father said Montgomery   Ward had opened a store and wanted a local athlete to manage its sports   department. Since Dixon was where I had played high school football, I applied.   The job sounded just right for me.<IMG hspace=0   src="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/language_tips/att/site1/20070115/xin_49010415094898532551.jpg"   align=right vspace=5 border=0 zmxid="zoomXimageId7" md5=""></P>  <P>But I wasn't hired. My disappointment must have shown. "Everything happens   for the best. " Mom reminded me. Dad offered me the car to hunt job. I tried WOC   Radio in Davenport, Iowa. The program director, a wonderful Scotsman named Peter   MacArthur told me they had already hired an announcer.</P>  <P>As I left his office, my frustration boiled over. I asked aloud, "How can a   fellow get to be a sports announcer if he can't get a job in a radio station." I   was waiting for the elevator when I heard MacArthur calling, "What was you said   about sports?</P>  <P>Do you know anything about football?" Then he stood me before a microphone   and asked me broadcast an imaginary game. The preceding autumn, my team had won   a game in the last 20 seconds with a 65－yard run. I did a 15－minute build－up to   that play, and Peter told me I would be broadcasting Saturday's game!</P>  <P>On my way home, as I have many times since, I thought of my mother's words:   "If you carry on, one day something good will happen. Something wouldn't have   happened if not for that previous disappointment.   "</P></FONT></DIV></div>
