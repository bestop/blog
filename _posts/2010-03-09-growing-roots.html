  <div><DIV>  <DIV class=sanjineiwen>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>When I was growing up, I had an   old neighbor named Dr. Gibbs. He didn't look like any doctor I'd ever known. He   never yelled at us for playing in his yard. I remember him as someone who was a   lot nicer than circumstances warranted.</FONT></P>  <P align=left><FONT face=Arial>When Dr. Gibbs wasn't saving lives, he was   planting trees. His house sat on ten acres, and his life's goal was to make it a   forest.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>The good doctor had some   interesting theories concerning plant husbandry. He came from the "No pain, no   gain" school of horticulture. He never watered his new trees, which flew in the   face of conventional wisdom. Once I asked why. He said that watering plants   spoiled them, and that if you water them, each successive tree generation will   grow weaker and weaker. So you have to make things rough for them and weed out   the weenie trees early on.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>He talked about how watering   trees made for shallow roots, and how trees that weren't watered had to grow   deep roots in search of moisture. I took him to mean that deep roots were to be   treasured.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>So he never watered his trees.   He'd plant an oak and, instead of watering it every morning, he'd beat it with a   rolled-up newspaper. Smack! Slap! Pow! I asked him why he did that, and he said   it was to get the tree's attention.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Dr. Gibbs went to glory a   couple of years after I left home. Every now and again, I walked by his house   and looked at the trees that I'd watched him plant some twenty-five years ago.   They're granite strong now. Big and robust. Those trees wake up in the morning   and beat their chests and drink their coffee black.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>I planted a couple of trees a   few years back. Carried water to them for a solid summer. Sprayed them. Prayed   over them. The whole nine yards. Two years of coddling has resulted in trees   that expect to be waited on hand and foot. Whenever a cold wind blows in, they   tremble and chatter their branches. Sissy trees.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Funny things about those trees   of Dr. Gibbs'. Adversity and deprivation seemed to benefit them in ways comfort   and ease never could.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Every night before I go to bed,   I check on my two sons. I stand over them and watch their little bodies, the   rising and falling of life within. I often pray for them. Mostly I pray that   their lives will be easy. But lately I've been thinking that it's time to change   my prayer.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>This change has to do with the   inevitability of cold winds that hit us at the core. I know my children are   going to encounter hardship, and I'm praying they won't be naive. There's always   a cold wind blowing somewhere.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>So I'm changing my prayer.   Because life is tough, whether we want it to be or not. Too many times we pray   for ease, but that's a prayer seldom met. What we need to do is pray for roots   that reach deep into the Eternal, so when the rains fall and the winds blow, we   won't be swept asunder.</FONT></P></DIV></DIV></div>
