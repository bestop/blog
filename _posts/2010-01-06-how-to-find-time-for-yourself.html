  <div class="post"><h2>{{ page.title }}</h2><strong>{{ page.date | date_to_long_string }}</strong><div><DIV>  <DIV class=sanjineiwen>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px">Do you ever find yourself longing for some time   for yourself? Many of us are so busy with work, school, and Home life that often   there is no time left over to do something that you enjoy. What follows are some   ways to carve out that essential time you need to slow down, enjoy life, and   rejuvenate yourself.</P>  <P align=right><IMG style="WIDTH: 246px; HEIGHT: 239px" id=822490 title=""   border=0 alt="How to Find Time for Yourself" align=right   src="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/language_tips/book/attachement/jpg/site1/20080512/0013729e42d20992392125.jpg"   zmxid="zoomXimageId6" md5="" sourcedescription="编辑提供的本地文件"   sourcename="本地文件"></P>  <P></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><STRONG>Scheduling Time with   Yourself</STRONG></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px">1. Evenings with Yourself. Try to save certain   weeknights just for you. If others ask you to do things those nights, just tell   them you have plans. Use the time for gardening, reading, exercise, thinking, or   the ultimate luxury of doing nothing!</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px">2. Monthly Treat. Schedule a treat for yourself   once a month. It could be on your lunch break, a weekend, or it could be leaving   work early. Maybe you get a spa treatment, go see a movie, a haircut, play golf,   or whatever treat you're always thinking about but rarely get to. Schedule it in   and it will happen!</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px">3. Buy Tickets in Advance. sports, theater,   concerts, or any other event you would enjoy. Schedule the plans with a friend   later. Having the tickets already in hand will force you to make it happen!</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px">4. Leave Work on Time. Huh? Yes, many of us stay   at work late on a regular basis. If this is you, make it a point to leave work   exactly on time at least once a week, if not more. And then enjoy that time!   Leave work at work.</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px">5. Join a Group. Here are some ideas of groups   that can allow you some time away from work and Home: singing group, gardening   group, astronomy society, book club, quilting (or any other craft) circle,   biking/walking/running/etc clubs, ski club, etc. What are you interested in?   Strike while the iron is hot. Look up a club in your area today and join! If you   can't find a club, consider starting one yourself!</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px">6. Take an Adult Education Class. Take a fun   class. If accounting is fun for you, then go ahead. If not, then think about   some of these ideas: foreign language, photography, art, creative writing, or   sports (kayaking, archery, golf, yoga). Belly-dancing anyone?</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px">7. Exercise. For busy people it can be difficult   to make time for this. But, you know what? You can do it!! All you have to do is   decide today and then make it a reality tomorrow. A new habit is started with   just one step. Take that first step tomorrow. Walk for 20 minutes in the   morning. And then build on that success daily. Vary how you spend that time. On   some days use the time for thinking and daydreaming. Other days listen to   motivational audio and on days you want a real boost, listen to your favorite   music! Here are a couple travel audio books you could borrow from your local   library that will take you on a journey to a foreign land while you are walking   or jogging: "Holy Cow:An Indian Adventure" by Sarah MacDonald or "The Places in   Between" by Rory Stewart. If you've been exercising for a while and you usually   listen to music, try go without any input for a change. Instead, let your mind   wander and expand.</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><STRONG>On the Go</STRONG></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px">1. Commute Via Public Transportation. If you   can, ditch your car, and let someone else do the driving. Use that time to plan   your day, do some reading, writing, creative thinking, or even meditation.</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px">2. Driving in Your Car. Make the most of this   time. Vary how you spend that time. If you always listen to music, perhaps also   try: educational radio (NPR), positive audio tapes (suggestion: "Follow Your   Heart" by Andrew Matthews) or even totally quiet time. Use that quiet time for   brain storming. Either think in your head or even talk your ideas out loud.   Bring a voice recorder. You could write a book via voice recorder over time.</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px">3. Waiting in the Car. If you find that you have   a certain amount of "waiting time" in your life, change how you perceive it.   Instead of "waiting time" you can instantly change it into "me time" by bringing   along reading, writing, or entertainment items. Or if you find yourself waiting   and you don't have any of these things use the time for creative thinking about   your life or try some meditation.</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><STRONG>Synergy</STRONG></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px">1. 2 Birds, One Stone. Look for ideas where you   can fit in time for you within things you need to do already or that will have   multiple benefits. See the ideas below to give you an idea.</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px">2. Walk to Work. This is a a great one because   you're accomplishing many things at once. You're getting exercise, you have time   to think or enjoy music/audio, and you're helping to save the environment.</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px">3. Arrive Early. Any appointment that you have,   plan to arrive 15-30 minutes early. Then use this time for you: reading,   writing, meditation, relaxation, thinking, whatever.</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px">4. Volunteering. There are so many benefits with   this. You make a difference for others, you escape work and personal worries,   and you grow as a person. If you could help one organization or group, which   would it be? OK, now go ahead and Google them and find out how you can help -   even if it's just once a year.</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px">5. Side Job. Find a side job at which you can   make money, but that will also allow you to do something you love. Some ideas:   coaching, teaching a class (art, writing, sport, hobby, anything else you know   well), or training others (what special skills do you have that you could share   with others? singing, windsurfing, math?)</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px">6. Lunch Alone. Try sneaking away for a quiet   lunch alone on a park bench or even in your car. Enjoy some quiet time with no   one to talk to and no audio inputs.</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><STRONG>Time Away from Kids</STRONG></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px">1. Organize "Mom's Morning Out" Circle. If you   have a friend or group of friends, you could arrange to share babysitting   services a few times a month so that others in the group get some time   alone.</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px">2. Babysitters. Make a plan to have a babysitter   that you trust watch your children once a month or once a week so that you can   get some time for yourself. The key here is to take action and make it happen.   If you want more time for yourself, you can get it. Just don't be afraid to   ask.</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px">3. Gym with Babysitting Service. Find a gym that   offers childcare so that you can take a yoga class, do some strength training,   or even work with a personal trainer. Make sure you fully research the safety of   their childcare program first though. Get some   references.</P></DIV></DIV></div>
