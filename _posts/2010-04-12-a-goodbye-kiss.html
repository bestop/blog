Bob started to stand up and jostled the table,   spilling his coffee over his notes. "How embarrassing.I am getting so clumsy in   my old age."</FONT></P>  <P align=left><FONT face=Arial><IMG style="WIDTH: 319px; HEIGHT: 212px"   id=1224904 title="" border=0 alt="A goodbye kiss 永别之吻" align=left   src="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/language_tips/book/attachement/jpg/site1/20090305/0013729e41a90b19b15809.jpg"   zmxid="zoomXimageId6" md5="" sourcedescription="编辑提供的本地文件"   sourcename="本地文件"></FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Everyone   had a good laugh, and soon we were all telling stories of our most embarrassing   moments. It came around to Frank who sat quietly listening to the others.   Someone said, "Come on, Frank. Tell us your most embarrassing   moment."</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Frank   laughed and began to tell us of his childhood. "I grew up in San Pedro. My Dad   was a fisherman, and he loved the sea. He had his own boat, but it was hard   making a living on the sea.He worked hard and would stay out until he caught   enough to feed the family. Not just enough for our family, but also for his Mom   and Dad and the other kids that were still at home."</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>He looked   at us and said, "I wish you could have met my Dad. He was a big man, and he was   strong from pulling the nets and fighting the seas for his catch. When you got   close to him, he smelled like the ocean. He would wear his old canvas,   foul-weather coat and his bibbed overalls. His rain hat would be pulled down   over his brow. No matter how much my Mother washed them, they would still smell   of the sea and of fish."</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Frank's   voice dropped a bit. "When the weather was bad he would drive me to school. He   had this old truck that he used in his fishing business. That truck was older   than he was. It would wheeze and rattle down the road. You could hear it coming   for blocks. As he would drive toward the school,I would shrink down into the   seat hoping to disappear. Half the time, he would slam to a stop and the old   truck would belch a cloud of smoke. He would pull right up in front, and it   seemed like everybody would be standing around and watching. Then he would lean   over and give me a big kiss on the cheek and tell me to be a good boy. It was so   embarrassing for me. Here, I was&nbsp;12 years old, and my Dad would lean over   and kiss me goodbye!"</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>He paused   and then went on, "I remember the day I decided I was too old for a goodbye   kiss. When we got to the school and came to a stop, he had his usual big smile.   He started to lean toward me, but I put my hand up and said, 'No,   Dad.'</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>It was the   first time I had ever talked to him that way, and he had this surprised look on   his face.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>I said,   'Dad, I'm too old for a goodbye kiss. I'm too old for any kind of   kiss.'</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>My Dad   looked at me for the longest time, and his eyes started to tear up. I had never   seen him cry. He turned and looked out the windshield. 'You're right,' he said.   'You are a big boy....a man. I won't kiss you anymore.'"</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Frank got a   funny look on his face, and the tears began to well up in his eyes, as he spoke.   "It wasn't long after that when my Dad went to sea and never came back. It was a   day when most of the fleet stayed in, but not Dad. He had a big family to feed.   They found his boat adrift with its nets half in and half out. He must have   gotten into a gale and was trying to save the nets and the floats."</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>I looked at   Frank and saw that tears were running down his cheeks. Frank spoke again. "Guys,   you don't know what I would give to have my Dad give me just one more kiss on   the cheek....to feel his rough old face....to smell the ocean on him....to feel   his arm around my neck. I wish I had been a man then. If I had been a man, I   would never have told my Dad I was too old for a goodbye   kiss."</FONT></P></DIV></DIV></div>
