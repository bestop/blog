Also keep an extra diaper bag with these   items in your car.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Store strollers, wagons,   blankets and cribs with appropriate wheels to evacuate infants, if   necessary.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Install bumper pads in cribs or   bassinettes to protect babies during the shaking.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Install latches on all   cupboards (not just those young children can reach) so that nothing can fall on   your baby during a quake.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><STRONG><FONT face=Arial>Preschool and   School-age Children</FONT></STRONG></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>By age three or so, children   can understand what an earthquake is and how to get ready for one. Take the time   to explain what causes earthquakes in terms they'll understand. Include your   children in family discussions and planning for earthquake safety. Conduct   drills and review safety procedures every six months.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Show children the safest places   to be in each room when an earthquake hits. Also show them all possible exits   from each room.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Use sturdy tables to teach   children to Duck, Cover &amp; Hold.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Teach children what to do   wherever they are during an earthquake (at school, in a tall building,   outdoors). Make sure children's emergency cards at school are   up-to-date.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Although children should not   turn off any utility valves, it's important that they know what gas smells like.   Advise children to tell an adult if they smell gas after an   earthquake.</FONT></P></DIV></DIV></div>
