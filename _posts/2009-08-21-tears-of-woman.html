  <div>有句话说：女人是水做的。是的，眼泪似乎是女人的专利。无论是伤心的泪，委屈的泪还是激动的泪，女人的眼泪是不受责备的。也许你不明白为什么女人天生爱流泪，那么请听上帝的解释……   <BR>A little boy asked his mother "why are you crying?" <BR><BR>"Because I'm a   woman," she told him. <BR><BR>"I don't understand," he said. <BR><BR>His mum   just hugged him and said, "and you never will." <BR><BR>Later the little boy   asked his father, "why does mother seem to cry for no reason?" <BR><BR>"All   women cry for no reason," was all his dad could say. <BR><BR>The little boy grew   up and became a man, still wondering why women cry. <BR><BR>Finally he put in a   call to god; and when god got on the phone, he asked, "god, why do women cry so   easily?" <BR><BR>God said: "when I made the woman she had to be special. I made   her shoulders strong enough to carry the weight of the world; yet, gentle enough   to give comfort." <BR><BR>"I gave her an inner strength to endure childbirth and   the rejection that many times comes from her children." <BR><BR>"I gave her a   hardness that allows her to keep going when everyone else gives up, and take   care of her family through sickness and fatigue without complaining. "   <BR><BR>"I gave her the sensitivity to love her children under any and all   circumstances, even when her child has hurt her very badly." <BR><BR>"I gave her   strength to carry her husband through his faults and fashioned her from his rib   to protect his heart." <BR><BR>"I gave her wisdom to know that a good husband   never hurts his wife, but sometimes tests her strengths and her resolve to stand   beside him unfalteringly." <BR><BR>"And finally, I gave her a tear to shed. This   is hers exclusively to use whenever it is needed." <BR><BR>"You see: the beauty   of a woman is not in the clothes she wears, the figure that she carries, or the   way she combs her hair." <BR><BR>"The beauty of a woman must be seen in her   eyes, because that is the doorway to her heart and the place where love   resides." <BR>  <DIV><FONT size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV></div>
