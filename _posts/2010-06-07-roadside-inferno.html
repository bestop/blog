  <div><DIV>  <DIV class=sanjineiwen>  <P><FONT face=Arial>Looks like a brush fire, Kim Cooper thought as she spotted   an orange glow ahead on Interstate 75. It was near dusk, and she and her   husband, Steve, were trucking through northern Kentucky hauling auto parts from   Louisville to Detroit for a freight company. Steve, 59, was fast asleep in the   truck's living quarters as Kim, 52, drove up to the scene. That's when she saw   it was much worse than a brush fire.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>"Steve, wake up!" she shouted. "There's a truck on fire!" A   big rig had tumbled down an embankment, and flames were crawling across its cab.   Kim yanked their truck to the side of the road, and Steve pulled on his clothes.   Then he scrambled down the slope.</FONT></P>  <P align=center><FONT face=Arial></FONT>  <CENTER><FONT face=Arial><IMG style="WIDTH: 500px; HEIGHT: 214px" id=1974497   title="" border=0 alt="Roadside inferno 火海救援" align=center   src="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/language_tips/book/attachement/jpg/site1/20091119/0013729e41a90c6f3c9416.jpg"   md5="" sourcedescription="编辑提供的本地文件" sourcename="本地文件"></FONT></CENTER>  <P><FONT face=Arial></FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>Inside the burning truck, Ronnie Sanders, 38, was fighting   for his life. He'd been running a heavy load of tractors and forklifts from   Georgia to Indianapolis when a Grand Caravan in front of him stopped suddenly in   traffic on the icy road. As Ronnie bore down, he could see children in the   backseat. The truck's bulk would probably protect him from the worst of the   impact, but the momentum of 23 tons would likely crush everyone inside the   van.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>"In Kentucky, the hills are steep, but at that moment, I   didn't think about it," he says of that evening last November. "I figured   instead of killing other people, I'd just put the truck in the ditch." He jerked   the wheel to the right, somehow keeping the truck upright as it plowed 60 feet   down the embankment. At the bottom, rocks pierced a fuel tank, which ignited. A   tree branch smashed through the windshield and knocked Ronnie unconscious. He   came to a couple of minutes later to find the cab in flames and his legs on   fire.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>Ronnie yelled for help as he struggled to escape. But the   cab was smashed in, and try as he might, he couldn't untangle himself from his   seat belt.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>As Steve bolted down the slope, he could hear Ronnie's cries   ahead. Then a thundering sound erupted behind him.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>A Ford Taurus, which had lost control in the melee above,   had skidded off the highway and was now barreling down the slope directly at   him. With no time to dive out of the way, he leaped upward and sailed over the   car's hood.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>The Taurus came to a halt close to the truck. Kim was   already scrambling toward the car. Its passengers appeared shaken but unharmed   as she helped maneuver the car away from the burning truck. Meanwhile, Steve   dashed to Ronnie, who was dangling headfirst from the passenger door. Ronnie had   used his pocketknife to cut himself free from the driver's-side seat belt only   to get his boot ensnared in another one. Steve climbed into the burning cab to   free him.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>"All that was going through my mind was, My God, I do not   want to be here," Steve recalls. "It was so hot, I could hardly stand   it."</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>He tried three times to pull Ronnie out before finally   freeing him. But Ronnie's legs were still burning, so Steve laid him on the   ground, ripped off his own shirt, and beat the flames with it. He'd managed to   drag him about 20 yards when one of the truck's 150-gallon fuel tanks   exploded.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>"It was like a cannon blast," says Steve. "The percussive   force hurt my chest. It just picked me up and blew me back." Fortunately, the   explosion was aimed skyward.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>Steve got up and peeled off what was left of Ronnie's   smoldering jeans and held his hand while they waited for the ambulance, as Kim   raced up and down the slope, grabbing wet towels and a blanket.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>Both Steve and Ronnie paid a price for risking their lives   for strangers. Ronnie spent two months in the hospital and received skin grafts   on both of his legs. He now wears compression garments for his scars and gets   physical therapy twice a week. "If Steve hadn't done what he did, I probably   would have been toast," he says. Steve suffered smoke inhalation and minor   burns, and shrapnel from the explosion broke a tooth.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>In February, the Coopers received a Hero of the Highway   award from the Open Road Foundation for rescuing an injured driver. Steve   insists Ronnie is the real hero: "If he hadn't gone into the ditch, he would   have hit that van. It was his decision to drive off the road."</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>"I feel pretty good about it," says Ronnie. "A lot of people   could have been hurt."</FONT></P></DIV></DIV></div>
