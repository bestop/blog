  <div><DIV>  <DIV class=sanjineiwen>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 1.5pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><EM><FONT   face=Arial></FONT></EM></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 1.5pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"If I never   saw this kid again, Lord, I wouldn't be sorry!" I thought. Tears clouded my eyes   as I stood in our laundry room. Clenched in both hands were new jeans and a   shirt belonging to my 16-year-old stepson, Brett. The clothing was already   destroyed from burn holes and vomit stains after a drunken binge.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 1.5pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Exhausted   and defeated, I sank to the floor. The clothes were just one more thing Brett   had ruined. He had already kicked a large hole in his bedroom wall; his   bedcovers were torn. Numerous windows in our house needed repair due to his   breaking in to steal money when he chose to live on the street. Yet none of this   could compare to the emotional damage Brett had inflicted on our once quiet   home.</FONT></P>  <P align=right><FONT face=Arial><IMG style="WIDTH: 316px; HEIGHT: 293px"   id=2240591 title="" border=0 alt="Love is action 爱在不言中" align=right   src="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/language_tips/book/attachement/jpg/site1/20100225/0013729e41a90cf05fa701.jpg"   md5="" sourcedescription="编辑提供的本地文件" sourcename="本地文件"></FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 1.5pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>I knew that   Brett's needs were deep, and I had often prayed for wisdom and love. The second   greatest commandment, "You shall love your neighbor as yourself," had taken on   new meaning when Brett came to live with us when he was 12 years old. If I were   to love my neighbor, was I not to love my own troubled stepson even   more?</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 1.5pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>During   those four years I had dealt with Brett as patiently as possible, but inside I   was churning. "I don't want him in my house another day, Lord," I cried as I   knelt on the laundry room floor. "I just can't stand him!"</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 1.5pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Chest   heaving, I poured out my despair. Then God tenderly spoke to me in my weakness.   Matthew 25:35-40 rose in my thoughts---Jesus' declaration that when we invite a   stranger, feed the hungry, clothe the naked or visit those in prison, we are   doing it as unto Him. For the first time I saw this story in light of the action   words. Jesus was saying, "Act. Meet these people's needs. Through your actions   you are loving them and Me."</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 1.5pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>God's   encouragement to me that day helped me to gather strength and continue parenting   Brett. Still, Brett did not change his behavior.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 1.5pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>When Brett   was nearly 18, he landed again in Juvenile Hall, this time on suicide watch.   Through prayer, my husband, Dave, and I sensed God's leading to send Brett to a   boarding school with a high success rate for helping troubled teens.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 1.5pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>The   psychological training at Brett's school was rigorous. Out of more than 20   people in his class, Brett was one of only five graduates.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 1.5pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>At the   graduation ceremony the graduates stood one by one to thank those who had helped   them. Each graduate held a long-stemmed, white rosebud to give to the person who   had meant the most to him or her.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 1.5pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Brett spoke   lovingly to his mother and father and for the first time took responsibility for   the heartaches he had caused.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 1.5pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Finally   Brett spoke to me. "You did so much," he said. "You were always there, no matter   what. My mom and dad, I was their kid. But you just got stuck with me. All the   same you always showed me such love. And I want you to know that I love you for   it."</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 1.5pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Stunned, I   stood as Brett placed the white rosebud in my hand and hugged me   hard.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 1.5pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>At that   moment I realized the truth in God's words to me. Although I had struggled with   silent anger toward my stepson, Brett had seen only my actions.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 1.5pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Love is   action. We may not always have positive feelings about certain people in our   lives. But we can love them.</FONT></P></DIV></DIV></div>
