  <div>Consider… YOU. In all time before now and in all time to   come, there has never been and will never be anyone just like you. You are   unique in the entire history and future of the universe. Wow! Stop and think   about that. You're better than one in a million, or a billion, or a gazillion…   <BR>　　 <BR>You are the only one like you in a sea of infinity! <BR>　　 <BR>You're   amazing! You're awesome! And by the way, TAG, you're it. As amazing and awesome   as you already are, you can be even more so. Beautiful young people are the   whimsey of nature, but beautiful old people are true works of art. But you don't   become "beautiful" just by virtue of the aging process. <BR>　　 <BR>Real beauty   comes from learning, growing, and loving in the ways of life. That is the Art of   Life. You can learn slowly, and sometimes painfully, by just waiting for life to   happen to you. Or you can choose to accelerate your growth and intentionally   devour life and all it offers. You are the artist that paints your future with   the brush of today. <BR>　　 <BR>Paint a Masterpiece. <BR>　　 <BR>God gives every   bird its food, but he doesn't throw it into its nest. Wherever you want to go,   whatever you want to do, it's truly up to you. <BR>  <DIV><FONT size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV></div>
