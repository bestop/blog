  <div><DIV><FONT size=2>  <DIV class=3jbiaoti>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV class=3jiriqi>Time spent in a bookshop can be most enjoyable, whether you   are a book-lover or merely you are there to buy a book as a present. You may   even have entered the shop just to find shelter from a sudden shower. Whatever   the reason, you can soon become totally unaware of your surroundings.</DIV>  <DIV class=3jineiwen>  <P>The desire to pick up a book with an attractive dust jacket is irresistible,   although this method of selection ought not to be followed, as you might end up   with a rather dull book.</P>  <P>You soon become engrossed in some book or other, and usually it is only much   later that you realize you have spent far too much time there and must dash off   to keep some forgotten appointment --without buying a book, of course.<IMG   hspace=0   src="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/language_tips/att/site1/20070312/xin_200304120947640223593.jpg"   align=right border=0 md5=""></P>  <P>This opportunity to escape the realities of everyday life is, I think , the   main attraction of a bookshop. There are not many places where it is possible to   do this. You can wander round such places to your heart's content. If it is a   good shop, no assistant to you with inevitable greeting, "Can I help you, sir?"   You finished browsing.</P>  <P>Then, and only then, are his services necessary. Of course you may want to   find out where a particular section is, but when he has led you there, the   assistant should retire carefully and look as if he is not interested in selling   a single book.</P>  <P>You have to be careful not to be attracted by the variety of books in a   bookshop. It is very easy to enter the shop looking for a book on ancient coins   and to come out carrying a copy of the latest best-selling novel. This sort of   thing can be very dangerous. Apart from running up a huge account, you can waste   great deal of time wandering from section to   section.<BR></P></DIV></FONT></DIV></div>
