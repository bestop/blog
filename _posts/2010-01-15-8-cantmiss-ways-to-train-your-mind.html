  <div><DIV>  <DIV class=sanjiriqi><FONT face=Arial>Our brain is like muscles. The more you   use and exercise it, the stronger it becomes. But, if you want to get maximum   results, you should do more than just practice. What you need is deliberate   practice. Deliberate practice is the kind of practice that stretches the   boundaries of your capabilities. While in normal practice you just do the same   activity again and again, in deliberate practice you push yourself to the limit.   It's not easy, but deliberate practice makes the difference between an expert   and everyone else.</FONT></DIV>  <DIV class=sanjineiwen>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>The principle of deliberate   practice can be applied in whatever field you want to excel in, but here I will   focus on mind development. Below are 8 ways to challenge and exercise your mind.   Choose some of them you haven't done and take your mind to the next   level:</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>1. Read challenging   articles</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>You can measure the difficulty   level of an article by using Google Docs. Here is how to do it:</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Create a new   document</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Paste the content of the   article to the new document</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Open the Tools -Word Count menu   item. It will show you three metrics: Flesch Reading Ease, Flesch-Kindcaid Grade   Level, and Automated Readability Index. The higher it is, the more difficult the   article is.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Of course, it's not necessary   to measure the difficulty level of every article you read. Simply take some   samples from a blog or web site and you will have good idea about the difficulty   level of the articles there.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>2. Read challenging   books</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Classic books are good   candidates since they are usually more difficult to read than new books. You   could start with my list of classic books. You can also read the   Pulitzer-winning books.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>3. Read academic   journals</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>One form of challenging reading   we often overlook is academic journals. There are a lot of free journal articles   you can read from Open science Directory. Some of the journal articles in Google   Scholar are also free. Go there, pick a topic of your interest and read a   journal article.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>4. Play mind games</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Choose a free mind game to play   and you can have fun while exercising your mind. I started playing Sudoku last   week and it was more difficult than I expected. But over time my mind got used   to it and I can now solve the puzzles faster.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>5. Aim to produce certain   number of ideas everyday</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>The ideas can be in whatever   fields you are working on. In my case, I try to write certain number of words   everyday. Q10 - which I first learned from Dale - is an excellent tool you can   use if you are a writer. One of its features is global target with which you can   set the target number of words you want to write.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>6. Brainstorm using thinking   tools</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>There are many thinking tools   you can use. The book Thinkertoys has many of them in one book and the web site   Exploratree has a collection of tools you can use.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>7. Do ultradian   sprint</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Doing ultradian sprint is a   good way to train your focus and concentration. One trait of a well-trained   brain is the ability to concentrate for long time and ultradian sprint can help   you increase your ability to concentrate.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>8. Set a project</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Is there a project that has   been in the back of your mind for some time? Perhaps you postpone it because you   think it's too difficult. Well, that's a good candidate for deliberate practice.   Often we are afraid of failure, but a mantra to quick progress is to make   mistakes and make them quick. This way you will have a short feedback loop that   will help you adjust your performance faster.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>As I wrote in the beginning of   this article, a key of deliberate practice is to push your current limit of   ability. These challenges will stretch your boundary when you first do them, but   after some time, you will get comfortable with it and it will no longer be   deliberate practice. Here are some things you can do to keep making them   deliberate practice:</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>1. For reading, try reading   something in an unfamiliar field or read more challenging materials in the same   field.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>2. For playing mind games,   increase the level of difficulty or try a new game you are not familiar   with.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>3. For producing certain number   of ideas everyday, increase the target number or the quality of the   ideas.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>4. For doing ultradian sprint,   increase the duration of the session.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>5. For thinking challenge, try   more difficult challenges.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>6. For setting project,   increase the scope of the project or do similar projects with stricter   deadline.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Do you have tips or thoughts on   mind exercise? I would love to hear them.</FONT></P></DIV></DIV></div>
