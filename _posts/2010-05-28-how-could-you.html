  <div><DIV>  <DIV class=sanjineiwen>  <P><FONT face=Arial>When I was a puppy, I entertained you with my antics and   made you laugh. You called me your child, and despite a number of chewed shoes   and a couple of murdered throw pillows, I became your best friend. Whenever I   was "bad," you'd shake your finger at me and ask "How could you?"-but then you'd   relent, and roll me over for a belly rub.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>My housebreaking took a little longer than expected, because   you were terribly busy, but we worked on that together. I remember those nights   of nuzzling you in bed and listening to your confidences and secret dreams, and   I believed that life could not be any more perfect. We went for long walks and   runs in the park, car rides, stops for ice cream (I only got the cone because   "ice cream is bad for dogs," you said), and I took long naps in the sun waiting   for you to come home at the end of the day.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>Gradually, you began spending more time at work and on your   career, and more time searching for a human mate. I waited for you patiently,   comforted you through heartbreaks and disappointments, never chided you about   bad decisions, and romped with glee at your homecomings, and when you fell in   love. She, now your wife, is not a "dog person"-still I welcomed her into our   home, tried to show her affection, and obeyed her. I was happy because you were   happy.</FONT></P>  <P align=center><FONT face=Arial></FONT>  <CENTER><FONT face=Arial><IMG style="WIDTH: 500px; HEIGHT: 313px" id=1857263   title="" border=0 alt="How could you? 一只狗狗的临终告白" align=center   src="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/language_tips/book/attachement/jpg/site1/20090930/0013729e41a90c2d4c4b53.jpg"   md5="" sourcedescription="编辑提供的本地文件" sourcename="本地文件"></FONT></CENTER>  <P><FONT face=Arial></FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>Then the human babies came along and I shared your   excitement. I was fascinated by their pinkness, how they smelled, and I wanted   to mother them, too. Only she and you worried that I might hurt them, and I   spent most of my time banished to another room, or to a dog crate. Oh, how I   wanted to love them, but I became a "prisoner of love." As they began to grow, I   became their friend. They clung to my fur and pulled themselves up on wobbly   legs, poked fingers in my eyes, investigated my ears, and gave me kisses on my   nose. I loved everything about them and their touch-because your touch was now   so infrequent-and I would have defended them with my life if need be. I would   sneak into their beds and listen to their worries and secret dreams, and   together we waited for the sound of your car in the driveway. 　</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>There had been a time, when others asked you if you had a   dog, that you produced a photo of me from your wallet and told them stories   about me. These past few years, you just answered "yes" and changed the subject.   I had gone from being "your dog" to "just a dog," and you resented every   expenditure on my behalf. Now, you have a new career opportunity in another   city, and you and they will be moving to an apartment that does not allow pets.   You've made the right decision for your "family," but there was a time when I   was your only family. 　</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>I was excited about the car ride until we arrived at the   animal shelter. It smelled of dogs and cats, of fear, of hopelessness. You   filled out the paperwork and said "I know you will find a good home for her".   They shrugged and gave you a pained look. They understand the realities facing a   middle-aged dog, even one with "papers". You had to pry your son's fingers loose   from my collar, as he screamed "No, Daddy. Please don't let them take my dog!"   And I worried for him, and what lessons you had just taught him about friendship   and loyalty, about love and responsibility, and about respect for all   life.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>You gave me a good-bye pat on the head, avoided my eyes, and   politely refused to take my collar and leash with you. You had a deadline to   meet and now I have one, too. After you left, the two nice ladies said you   probably knew about your upcoming move months ago and made no attempt to find me   another good home. They shook their heads and asked "How could you?"</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>They are as attentive to us here in the shelter as their   busy schedules allow. They feed us, of course, but I lost my appetite days ago.   At first, whenever anyone passed my pen, I rushed to the front, hoping it was   you-that you had changed your mind-that this was all a bad dream…or I hoped it   would at least be someone who cared, anyone who might save me. When I realized I   could not compete with the frolicking for attention of happy puppies, oblivious   to their own fate, I retreated to a far corner and waited.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>I heard her footsteps as she came for me at the end of the   day, and I padded along the aisle after her to a separate room. A blissfully   quiet room. She placed me on the table and rubbed my ears, and told me not to   worry. My heart pounded in anticipation of what was to come, but there was also   a sense of relief. The prisoner of love had run out of days. As is my nature, I   was more concerned about her. The burden which she bears weighs heavily on her,   and I know that, the same way I knew your every mood. She gently placed a   tourniquet around my foreleg as a tear ran down her cheek. I licked her hand in   the same way I used to comfort you so many years ago. She expertly slid the   hypodermic needle into my vein. As I felt the sting and the cool liquid coursing   through my body, I lay down sleepily, looked into her kind eyes and murmured   "How could you?"</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>Perhaps because she understood my dogspeak, she said "I'm so   sorry." She hugged me, and hurriedly explained it was her job to make sure I   went to a better place, where I wouldn't be ignored or abused or abandoned, or   have to fend for myself-a place of love and light so very different from this   earthly place.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>And with my last bit of energy, I tried to convey to her   with a thump of my tail that my "How could you?" was not directed at her. It was   you, My Beloved Master, I was thinking of. I will think of you and wait for you   forever. May everyone in your life continue to show you so much   loyalty.</FONT></P></DIV></DIV></div>
