He had already passed sixty of the stages   leading to it, and he had brought from his journey nothing but errors and   remorse.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>The days of his youth appeared   like dreams before</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>&nbsp;him, and he recalled the   serious moment when his father placed him at the entrance of the two roads-one   leading to a peaceful, sunny place, covered with flowers, fruits and resounding   with soft, sweet songs；the other leading to a deep, dark cave, which was   endless.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>He looked towards the sky and   cried painfully, ″O youth, return！O my father, place me once more at the   entrance to life, and I'll choose the better way！″But both his father and the   days of his youth had passed away.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>The clock in the high church   tower struck and the sound made him remember his parents' early love for him.   They had taught him and prayed to God for his good. But he chose the wrong way.   His darkened eyes were full of tears, and with a despairing effort, he burst out   a cry: ″Come back, my early days！Come back！″</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>And his youth did return, for   all this was only a dream which he had on New Year's Night.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Those who still linger on the   entrance of life, hesitating to choose the bright road, remember that when years   are passed and your feet stumble on the dark mountains, you will cry bitterly,   but in vain: ″O youth, return！Oh give me back my early   days！″</FONT></P></DIV></DIV></div>
