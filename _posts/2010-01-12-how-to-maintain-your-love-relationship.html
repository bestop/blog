  <div><DIV>  <DIV class=sanjiriqi><FONT face=Arial>In order to experience everlasting love in   life, you ought to first figure out what is missing in your life and then fill   in the gaps. People fall in and out of love because they expect their lovers to   be everything to them and do everything for them. They then become dissatisfied   when the partner fails to meet all their requirements. If you have a dream of   achieving everlasting love you better create your very own life crowned by   hobbies, interests and beneficial passions. This makes you a full lover when you   enjoy a complete, interesting life on your own. Create a world of your own. On   your to-do-list add forgiveness. It is always healthy to forgive while you can,   disappointments and sadness is a part of life.</FONT></DIV>  <DIV class=sanjineiwen>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Some people find it hard to   forgive their partners especially if they happened to catch them cheating on   them. Seek professional help from a marriage and relationship counselor. This is   an important move towards search for everlasting love. Most buried resentments   are the cause to failed marriages and broken relationships. At one time they   resurface and blow the present things out of proportion. To find a smooth sail   in your love life you have to learn to forgive and move on with a clean slate.   Accept changes when they arrive instead of fighting the reality. In life change   is inevitable. At one time you will be loved, dumped, married, you will have   children, become sick and die. You should acknowledge the happenings in life and   move through them strongly. No matter how settled you might be it is good to   know that things can change in an instant.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial><STRONG>Always accept the   unexpected. Always find Happiness in what you have and be grateful to own what   you have.</STRONG> It is a great secret to everlasting love. Despite the   greatest fear and uncertainties of the unknown, when the inevitable things   happen you will look back on the good old times and wish that you had been more   grateful when things were more colorful. To enjoy your love life you should give   thanks every moment and learn to appreciate the small problems we experience   because unknown to us they can get worse and some time they probably will. To   experience how it feels to have everlasting love, create time for each other as   lovers. Many people who are unhappy keep on postponing time to be together.   People get caught up in the many and demanding daily activities and forget to   get time to live for today.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>It happens to me and you. There   will always be more laundry, more house chores and more errands to be carried   out. It is a routine where we retire to bed when we are very exhausted late at   night only to awake and follow the same routine again the next day. To live life   to the fullest stop at some point and take time for yourself and for each other   too.&nbsp; Today might be the only gift you have in life so live like there is   no tomorrow. The precious moments we reckon in life are achieved by creating   time for them against the much pressure of work. Create such short and fleeting   moments everyday to enjoy everlasting love.</FONT></P></DIV></DIV></div>
