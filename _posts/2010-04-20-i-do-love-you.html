Papa handed him the family's savings hidden in a leather satchel.   "Times are desperate here," he said, hugging his son goodbye. "You are our   hope."</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Edward   boarded the Atlantic freighter offering free transport to young men willing to   shovel coal in return for the month-long journey. If Edward struck gold in the   Colorado Rockies, the rest of the family could eventually join him.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>For months,   Edward worked his claim tirelessly, and the small vein of gold provided a   moderate but steady income. Leaving Ingrid behind before he could officially   court her had been his only regret in accepting this American adventure. He had   secretly hoped to make Ingrid his wife. Finally, he wrote to Papa, asking him to   help make this dream come true.</FONT></P>  <P align=right><FONT face=Arial><IMG   style="BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 0px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 0px solid; BORDER-TOP: #000000 0px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 0px solid"   id=1278898 title="" border=0 alt=不，我爱的人是你！ align=right   src="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/language_tips/book/attachement/jpg/site1/20090409/0013729e41a90b47dbdf02.jpg"   width=298 height=191 zmxid="zoomXimageId6" md5="" sourcedescription="编辑提供的本地文件"   sourcename="本地文件"></FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>After nearly   a year, a telegraph came with a plan to make his life complete. Mr. Henderson   had agreed to send his daughter to Edward in America. Because she was a   hardworking young woman with a good mind for business, she would work alongside   Edward for a year to help the mining business grow. By then both families could   afford to come to America for their wedding.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Edward's   heart soared with joy as he spent the next month trying to make the cabin into a   home. At last, the day he had been waiting for his whole life arrived. With a   bouquet of fresh-picked daisies in hand, he left for the train depot. Steam   billowed and wheels screeched as the train crawled to a stop.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>His heart   beat with eager anticipation, then stopped with a sinking thud. Not Ingrid, but   her older sister Marta, stepped down from the train.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Edward only   stared － dumbfounded. Then with shaking hands he offered Marta the bouquet.   "Welcome," he whispered, his eyes burning. A smile etched across her plain   face.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"I was   pleased when Papa said you sent for me," Marta said, looking into his eyes   briefly, before dropping her head again.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"I'll get   your bags, "Edward said with a fake smile. Together they headed for the   buggy.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Mr. Henderson   and Papa were right. Marta did have a great grasp of business. Within&nbsp;6   months, their assets doubled.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Her delicious   meals and quiet smile graced the cabin with a wonderful woman's touch. But the   wrong woman, Edward mourned as he collapsed onto his cot each night. Why did   they send Marta? Would he ever see Ingrid again? Was his lifelong dream to have   her as his wife forsaken?</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>For a year,   Marta and Edward worked and played and laughed, but never loved. Once, Marta had   kissed Edward on the cheek before retiring to her room. He only smiled   awkwardly. From then on, she seemed content with their exhilarating hikes in the   mountains and long talks on the porch after suppers.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>One spring   afternoon, torrential rains washed down the hillside, eroding the entrance to   their mine. Furiously, Edward filled sand bags and stacked them in the water's   path. Suddenly there was Marta at his side holding the next burlap bag open.   Edward shoveled sand inside, then with the strength of any man, Marta hurled it   onto the pile and opened another bag… For hours they worked, knee-deep in mud,   until the rains diminished.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Hand in hand,   they walked back to the cabin. Over warm soup Edward sighed, "I never could have   saved the mine without you. Thank you, Marta."</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"You're   welcome," she answered with her usual smile, then went quietly to her room. A   few days later, a telegraph came announcing the arrival of the Henderson and   Wellman families next week. As much as he tried to stifle it, the thought of   seeing Ingrid again started Edward's heart beating in the old familiar   way.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Together, he   and Marta went to the train station. They watched as their families exited the   train at the far end of the platform. When Ingrid appeared, Marta turned to   Edward. "Go to her," she said.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Astonished,   Edward stammered, "What do you mean?"</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"Edward, I   have always known I was not the Henderson girl you intended to send for. I had   watched you flirt with Ingrid at the church picnics.&nbsp;I know it is she, not   me, you desire for your wife." "But ..."</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Marta placed   her fingers over his lips. "Shhh," she hushed him. "I do love you, Edward. I   always have. And because of that, all I really want is your happiness. Go to   her." As she gazed up at him, he saw for the first time how very beautiful she   was. He recalled their walks in the meadows, their quiet evenings before the   fire, her working beside him with the sandbags. It was then he realized what he   had known for months. "No, Marta. It is you I want." Sweeping her into his arms,   he kissed her with all the love bursting inside him. Their families gathered   around them chorusing, "We are here for the   wedding!"</FONT></P></DIV></div>
