  <div><DIV><FONT size=2 face="Comic Sans MS">A farmer had some puppies he needed to   sell. He painted a sign advertising the pups and set about nailing it to a post   on the edge of his yard. As he was driving the last nail into the post, he felt   a tug on his overalls. He looked down into the eyes of a little boy.   <BR><BR>"Mister," he said, "I want to buy one of your puppies." <BR><BR>"Well,"   said the farmer, as he rubbed the sweat off the back of his neck, "these puppies   come from fine parents and cost a good deal of money." <BR><BR>The boy dropped   his head for a moment. Then reaching deep into his pocket, he pulled out a   handful of change and held it up to the farmer. "I've got thirty-nine cents. Is   that enough to take a look?" <BR><BR>"Sure," said the farmer. <BR><BR>And with   that he let out a whistle, "Here, Dolly!" he called. <BR><BR>Out from the   doghouse and down the ramp ran Dolly followed by four little balls of fur. The   little boy pressed his face against the chain link fence. His eyes danced with   delight. <BR><BR>As the dogs made their way to the fence, the little boy noticed   something else stirring inside the doghouse. Slowly another little ball   appeared; this One noticeably smaller. Down the ramp it slid. Then in a somewhat   awkward manner the little pup began hobbling toward the others, doing its best   to catch up. <BR><BR>"I want that one," the little boy said, pointing to the   runt. <BR><BR>The farmer knelt down at the boy's side and said, "Son, you don't   want that puppy. He will never be able to run and play with you like these other   dogs would." <BR><BR>With that the little boy stepped back from the fence,   reached down, and began rolling up one leg of his trousers. In doing so he   revealed a steel brace running down both sides of his leg attaching itself to a   specially made shoe. Looking back up at the farmer, he said, "You see sir, I   don't run too well myself, and he will need someone who understands."   <BR><BR>The world is full of people who need someone who   understands.</FONT></DIV></div>
