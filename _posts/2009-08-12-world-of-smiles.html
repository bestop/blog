  <div><DIV><FONT size=2>  <P><BR>About ten years ago when I was an undergraduate in college, I was working   as an intern at my University's Museum of Natural History. One day while working   at the cash register in the gift shop, I saw an elderly couple come in with a   little girl in a wheelchair.</P>  <P>As I looked closer at this girl, I saw that she was kind of perched on her   chair. I then realized she had no arms or legs, just a head, neck and torso. She   was wearing a little white dress with red polka dots.</P>  <P>As the couple wheeled her up to me I was looking down at the register. I   turned my head toward the girl and gave her a wink. As I took the money from her   grandparents, I looked back at the girl, who was giving me the cutest, largest   smile I have ever seen.</P>  <P>All of a sudden her handicap was gone and all I saw was this beautiful girl,   whose smile just melted me and almost instantly gave me a completely new sense   of what life is all about. She took me from a poor, unhappy college student and   brought me into her world; a world of smiles, love and warmth.</P>  <P>That was ten years ago. I'm a successful business person now and whenever I   get down and think about the troubles of the world, I think about that little   girl and the remarkable lesson about life that she taught   me.</P></FONT></DIV></div>
