  <div><DIV>  <DIV class=3jineiwen>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>To this day I remember my mum's   letters. It all started in December 1941. Every night she sat at the big table   in the kitchen and wrote to my brother Johnny, who had been drafted that summer.   We had not heard from him since the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>I didn't understand why my mum   kept writing Johnny when he never wrote back.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"Wait and see-we'll get a   letter from him one day," she claimed. Mum said that there was a direct link   from the brain to the written word that was just as strong as the light God has   granted us. She trusted that this light would find Johnny.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>I don't know if she said that   to calm herself, dad or all of us down. But I do know that it helped us stick   together, and one day a letter really did arrive. Johnny was alive on an island   in the Pacific.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>I had always been amused by the   fact that mum signed her letters, "Cecilia Capuzzi", and I teased her about   that. "Why don't you just write 'Mum'?" I said.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>I hadn't been aware that she   always thought of herself as Cecilia Capuzzi. Not as Mum. I began seeing her in   a new light, this small delicate woman, who even in high-heeled shoes was barely   one and a half meters tall.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>She never wore make-up or   jewelry except for a wedding ring of gold. Her hair was fine, sleek and black   and always put up in a knot in the neck. She wouldn't hear of getting a haircut   or a perm. Her small silver-rimmed pince-nez only left her nose when she went to   bed.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Whenever mum had finished a   letter, she gave it to dad for him to post it. Then she put the water on to   boil, and we sat down at the table and talked about the good old days when our   Italian-American family had been a family of ten: mum, dad and eight children.   Five boys and three girls. It is hard to understand that they had all moved away   from home to work, enroll in the army, or get married. All except me.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Around next spring mum had got   two more sons to write to. Every evening she wrote three different letters which   she gave to me and dad afterwards so we could add our greetings.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Little by little the rumour   about mum's letters spread. One day a small woman knocked at our door. Her voice   trembled as she asked: "Is it true you write letters?"</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"I write to my   sons."</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"And you can read too?"   whispered the woman.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"Sure."</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>The woman opened her bag and   pulled out a pile of airmail letters. "Readâ€¦ please read them aloud to   me."</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>The letters were from the   woman's son who was a soldier in Europe, a red-haired boy who mum remembered   having seen sitting with his brothers on the stairs in front of our house. Mum   read the letters one by one and translated them from English to Italian. The   woman's eyes welled up with tears. "Now I have to write to him," she said. But   how was she going to do it?</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"Make some coffee, Octavia,"   mum yelled to me in the living room while she took the woman with her into the   kitchen and seated her at the table. She took the fountain pen, ink and air mail   notepaper and began to write. When she had finished, she read the letter aloud   to the woman.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"How did you know that was   exactly what I wanted to say?"</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"I often sit and look at my   boys' letters, just like you, without a clue about what to write."</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>A few days later the woman   returned with a friend, then another one and yet another one--they all had sons   who fought in the war, and they all needed letters. Mum had become the   correspondent in our part of town. Sometimes she would write letters all day   long.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Mum always insisted that people   signed their own letters, and the small woman with the grey hair asked mum to   teach her how to do it. "I so much want to be able to write my own name so that   my son can see it." Then mum held the woman's hand in hers and moved her hand   over the paper again and again until she was able to do it without her   help.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>After that day, when mum had   written a letter for the woman, she signed it herself, and her face brightened   up in a smile.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>One day she came to us, and mum   instantly knew what had happened. All hope had disappeared from her eyes. They   stood hand in hand for a long time without saying a word. Then mum said: "We   better go to church. There are certain things in life so great that we cannot   comprehend them." When mum came back home, she couldn't get the red-haired boy   out of her mind.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>After the war was over, mum put   away the pen and paper. "Finito," she said. But she was wrong. The women who had   come to her for help in writing to their sons now came to her with letters from   their relatives in Italy. They also came to ask her for her help in getting   American citizenship.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>On one occasion mum admitted   that she had always had a secret dream of writing a novel. "Why didn't you?" I   asked.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"All people in this world are   here with one particular purpose," she said. "Apparently, mine is to write   letters." She tried to explain why it absorbed her so.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"A letter unites people like   nothing else. It can make them cry, it can make them laugh. There is no caress   more lovely and warm than a love letter, because it makes the world seem very   small, and both sender and receiver become like kings in their own kingdoms. My   dear, a letter is life itself!"</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Today all mum's letters are   lost. But those who got them still talk about her and cherish the memory of her   letters in their hearts.</FONT></P></DIV></DIV></div>
