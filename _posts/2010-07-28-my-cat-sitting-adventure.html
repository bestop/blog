  <div class="post"><h2>{{ page.title }}</h2><strong>{{ page.date | date_to_long_string }}</strong><div><DIV>  <DIV class=sanjineiwen>  <P><FONT face=Arial>Why and how I got myself into this situation is still   unclear to me. A lady friend, a quite good looking lady friend, (okay, okay, so   I do know why and how I got myself into this situation) asked me to check her   two cats while she was out of town for several days. I said, "Sure." I thought   to myself, "How difficult could it be to check on her cats?" Before she left she   told me that one of her cats was on medication for dry skin. Yes, dry skin. I   thought to myself, "Give me a break!" However I kept my mouth shut because she   is a good friend and as I said before, quite a good looking friend. Her one cat   was required to take two pills a day and also needed to have Neosporin put on a   sore on his skin. "No problem", I foolishly replied.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>First of all, I do not, never did, and probably never will   understand women and their fascination with cats. Cats like their independence,   they never listen to you and they won't come to you if you call them. They are   lazy, enjoy sleeping all day and staying out all night. If they drank beer and   watched sports on television then they would be just like most of the men that   these women have dated in their lives. Yet they&nbsp;love their cats. Many   single women I know have cats. They never seem to have just one cat, they   usually have at least two cats. Why? So the cats will have company when the   woman is away. I never did understand why a cat, an animal that is very   independent, would need or even want company when its owner is away. I would   think that most cats are probably happy when their owner is away. They finally   have got the entire place to themselves. However many women I know insist on   having a second cat to keep the first cat company. All of these women are   single. I also know of one woman who owns seven cats. She is also single. I   believe it is because she owns seven cats.</FONT></P>  <P align=center><FONT face=Arial></FONT>  <DIV align=left><FONT face=Arial><IMG style="WIDTH: 450px; HEIGHT: 300px"   id=2118140 title="" border=0 alt="My cat sitting adventure 我的猫保姆经历" align=center   src="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/language_tips/book/attachement/jpg/site1/20100107/0013729e41a90caf849b03.jpg"   md5="" sourcedescription="编辑提供的本地文件" sourcename="本地文件"></FONT></DIV>  <P><FONT face=Arial></FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>I arrived at my lady friend's house at 11 a.m. and found a   note instructing me what to do. "Check food". The food is A-OK. "Check Water".   Well, the water dish was a little low so I'll add some water. However the note   instructed me to "Only&nbsp;give them bottled water which is in the   refrigerator"! I thought to myself, "Bottled water? The cats only drink bottled   water?" When I visit my lady friend and ask for water, she gives me tap water. I   may have to re-evaluate my friendship with this lady friend. I filled the cats'   water dish with the aforementioned bottled water. I read the rest of the   instructions she had left for me. The note went on saying, "Poopy bags are in   the flowered green fabric holder hanging off the metal rack beside the litter   box." Yes, you read me right, she wrote, "poopy bags." I&nbsp;really have to   re-evaluate my friendship with this woman.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>Now it is time to give Lucas, the male cat, his medicine. I   was instructed to hide the pill inside some veggie cheese. Yes, the cat likes   veggie cheese, made from soy. Apparently Lucas is a bottled water drinking,   vegetarian cat. I did as instructed and put the pill inside the veggie cheese.   The cat not only ate all of the veggie cheese, he also somehow managed to eat   around the pill. All of the veggie cheese was gone yet the pill remained. I now   must think of a "Plan B."</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>I decided to hide the pill in a piece of turkey. What the   heck? I could not have any worse luck, could I? Lucas ate the turkey and once   again managed to eat around the pill. One thing was certain. Lucas is not a   vegetarian. I next attempted to hide the pill in some tuna. Albacore, actually.   Again, Lucas ate all of the tuna and left the pill. Another thing was certain.   Lucas likes to eat.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>I then remembered my lady friend saying that I could hide   the pill inside a cat snack treat. Aha! The old hiding the pill in a cat snack   treat routine. I proceeded to find the cat treats. There were "Grilled Yellowfin   Tuna Flavored Treats" and "Shrimp and Crab Medley Flavored Treats" and "Oven   Roasted Breast of Chicken Flavored Treats" and "Hearty Beef Flavored Treats" and   "Salmon Flavored Treats." These cats eat better than most people. I decided to   first try the "Whiskas Temptations Salmon Flavored Treats." Why? Because on the   package it read, "What Cats Want". That was good enough for me. Unfortunately it   was not what this cat wanted. I put the pill in each of the treats and Lucas   would not go near any of the them. One more thing was certain. Lucas was full. I   now must wait until he gets hungry again. I had not thought that this would be   an all day event.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>While waiting for Lucas to get hungry again I thought I   would make an attempt to put the Neosporin on his sore. This went better than   expected. I accomplished this task in a mere 45 minutes and I successfully   managed not to bleed on any of my friend's furniture as I ran to the bathroom to   cleanse my multiple scratch wounds. Although Lucas may not hold a high regard   for Neosporin, I have a new found appreciation for it.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>Afterwards I noticed Lucas licking the Neosporin off of his   sore. My first thought was, "Well, that was a complete waste of time and blood!"   Then I got an idea. I'll put some Neosporin on his pill. He seems to like the   taste of Neosporin. And you know what? It&nbsp;did not work either! So much for   shouting with glee and becoming rich of my idea for a "Neosporin Flavored Cat   Treat".</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>I looked at my watch. It was almost 2 o'clock. This   unsuccessful ordeal had taken almost 3 hours! And I am supposed to do this twice   a day for the next four days. Yet one more thing was certain. I must come up   with a "Plan C".&nbsp;</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>Knowing that I had made a valid attempt made it easier to   implement "Plan C". Because of "Plan C", day two, three, and four of my   cat-sitting adventure went smoothly. My lady friend arrived home late on day   four, none the wiser, thanking me again and again for looking after her beloved   cats. What was "Plan C"? Well, "Plan C" was a simple plan. I figured that since   Lucas was required to take 2 pills a day for 4 days then that would equate to 8   pills. (Thank God for calculators!) I took 8 pills out of the bottle and threw   them in the garbage. I used the Neosporin on my own wounds thus making it look   like I used it on Lucas. I did not bother going over to her house to check on   the cats at&nbsp;all on day 2 or 3. I went over just on day 4 to change the   water and litter box in order to make it appear like I did everything she wanted   me to do. You may be asking yourselves, "Doesn't he feel any sense of guilt for   his deceitful ways?" The answer is, "No!". Well, maybe someday I will, after my   wounds heal and the scars fade away. I did not want to implement "Plan C" but I   had no other choice. I could not afford to waste several hours of my valuable   time along with losing a pint of blood each day. Not when there are "Friends"   returns to watch on television. Besides, that will teach her to give me tap   water!</FONT></P></DIV></DIV></div>
