  <div><DIV>The Hippocratic Oath <BR>　　<BR>　　I swear by Apollo the physician, by  Aesculapius, Hygeia, and Panacea, and I take to witness all the gods, all the  goddesses, to keep according to my ability and my judgement the following oath.  <BR>　　To consider dear to me as my parents him who taught me this art, to live  in common with him, and if necessary to share my goods with him, to look upon  him children as my own brothers, to teach them this art if they so desire  without fee or written promise, to impart to my sons and the sons of the master  who taught me and the disciples who have enrolled themselves and have agreed to  the rules of the profession, but to these alone, the precepts and the  instruction. <BR>　　I will prescribe regimen for the good of my patients  according to my ability and my judgement and never do harm to anyone. To please  no one will I prescribe a deadly drug, nor give advice which may cause his  death. Nor will I give a woman a pessary to procure abortion. But I will  preserve the purity of my life and my art. I will not cut for stone, even for  patients in whom the disease is manifest. I will leave this operation to be  performed by practitioners (specialist in this art). In every house where I come  I will enter only for the good of my patients, keeping myself far from all  intentional ill-doing and all seduction. All that may come to my knowledge in  the exercise of my profession or in daily commerce with men, which ought not to  be spread abroad, I will keep secret and will never reveal it. <BR>　　If I keep  this oath faithfully, may I enjoy my life and practice my art, respected by all  men and in all times, but if I swerve from it or violate it, may the reverse be  my lot. <BR>　　<BR>　　<BR>　　<BR>　　希波克拉底誓言(公元前5世纪)<BR>　　  <BR>　　　仰赖医神阿波罗・埃斯克雷彼斯及天地诸神为证，鄙人敬谨宣誓愿以自身能力及判断力所急，遵守此约。凡授我艺者敬之如父母，作为终身同业伴侣，彼有急需我接济之。视彼儿女，犹我兄弟，如欲受业，当免费并无条件传授之。凡我所知无论口授书传俱传之吾子，吾师之子及发誓遵守此约之生徒，此外不传他人。  <BR>　　　　我愿尽余之能力与判断力所及，遵守为病家谋利益之信条，并检束一切堕落及害人行为，我不得将危害药品给予他人，并不作该项之指导，虽有人请求亦不与之。尤不为妇人施堕胎手术。我愿以此纯洁与神圣之精神，终身执行我职务。凡患结石者，我不施手术，此则有待于专家为之。  <BR>　　　　无论至于何处，遇男或女、贵人及奴婢，我之唯一目的，为病家谋幸福，并检点吾身，不作各种害人及恶劣行为，尤不作诱奸之事。凡我所见所闻，无论有无业务关系，我认为应守秘密者，我愿保守秘密。尚使我严守上述誓言时，请求神抵让我生命与医术能得无上光荣，我苟违誓，天地鬼神实共亟之。  <BR>　　<BR>　　注：希波克拉底(约公元前460―371)，古希腊著名医生，治学严谨，医术精湛，医德高尚。<BR></DIV></div>
