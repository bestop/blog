  <div><div style="FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma; DIRECTION: ltr; COLOR: #000000; FONT-SIZE: 13px"> <div></div> <div dir="ltr"><font color="#000000" face="Tahoma"> <p style="TEXT-ALIGN: left; LINE-HEIGHT: 150%; MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto" class="MsoNormal" align="left"> <span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'" lang="EN-US"><font size="2">No matter how perfect everything can feel and how awesome life can seem at times, things rarely stay that way. Let's face it, now and then we all experience the low points, and for  some people, those low points can last a lot longer than anything else. You can tell just by looking at statistics which show that tens of thousands of people commit suicide each year around the world; for some people these low points just become unbearable. <?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /> <o:p></o:p></font></span></p> <p style="TEXT-ALIGN: left; LINE-HEIGHT: 150%; MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto" class="MsoNormal" align="left"> <span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'" lang="EN-US"><font size="2">I think there are some key aspects which can help people start to really enjoy life again, and make the most of the opportunities on this planet. In this post I want to look at what  I think those aspects are and how you can incorporate them into your life.<o:p></o:p></font></span></p> <p style="TEXT-ALIGN: left; LINE-HEIGHT: 150%; MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto" class="MsoNormal" align="left"> <b><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'" lang="EN-US"><font size="2">Become Aware of your Mortality</font></span></b><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'" lang="EN-US"><br> <br> <font size="2">I know that point heading doesn't sound very positive, but let me pan things out a bit. It's no secret that one day we are all going to die. Some of you may think we will be reincarnated, some may think we will go to heaven and some of you think  we are spiritual beings in human form, and that's fine. However, all of us know that our current form won't last forever.<o:p></o:p></font></span></p> <p style="TEXT-ALIGN: left; LINE-HEIGHT: 150%; MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto" class="MsoNormal" align="left"> <span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'" lang="EN-US"><font size="2">I've always been aware that I'm going to die someday, but I don't think I have ever really appreciated life. It wasn't until I became very sick last year and spent a week in hospital  that the things which matter to me really became apparent, my health being one of them.<o:p></o:p></font></span></p> <p style="TEXT-ALIGN: left; LINE-HEIGHT: 150%; MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto" class="MsoNormal" align="left"> <span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'" lang="EN-US"><font size="2">This is it. Make the most of the opportunity you have; life is completely what you make of it and is nothing more than an external reflection of your internal thoughts. If you start  looking for the good in the world instead of focusing on the bad, I promise you will find it.<o:p></o:p></font></span></p> <p style="TEXT-ALIGN: left; LINE-HEIGHT: 150%; MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto" class="MsoNormal" align="left"> <b><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'" lang="EN-US"><font size="2">Make Notes of the Things that Matter to You</font></span></b><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'" lang="EN-US"><br> <br> <font size="2">I used to be the kind of person that would read a blog post which asked you to do something, and kindly skip over the 'taking action' section. More recently, I actually took the time to write out a list of things I'm grateful for; some of the  obvious items came up:<o:p></o:p></font></span></p> <p style="TEXT-ALIGN: left; LINE-HEIGHT: 150%; MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto" class="MsoNormal" align="left"> <span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'" lang="EN-US"><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * My family and friends<o:p></o:p></font></span></p> <p style="TEXT-ALIGN: left; LINE-HEIGHT: 150%; MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto" class="MsoNormal" align="left"> <span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'" lang="EN-US"><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * My health<o:p></o:p></font></span></p> <p style="TEXT-ALIGN: left; LINE-HEIGHT: 150%; MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto" class="MsoNormal" align="left"> <span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'" lang="EN-US"><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Being able to eat properly every day<o:p></o:p></font></span></p> <p style="TEXT-ALIGN: left; LINE-HEIGHT: 150%; MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto" class="MsoNormal" align="left"> <span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'" lang="EN-US"><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Having a roof over my head<o:p></o:p></font></span></p> <p style="TEXT-ALIGN: left; LINE-HEIGHT: 150%; MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto" class="MsoNormal" align="left"> <span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'" lang="EN-US"><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Having people that care for me<o:p></o:p></font></span></p> <p style="TEXT-ALIGN: left; LINE-HEIGHT: 150%; MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto" class="MsoNormal" align="left"> <span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'" lang="EN-US"><font size="2">And while these items are obvious, we take them for granted but miss them so much for example when they deteriorate (health) or disappear (wealth). Simply doing this will allow you  to see all the great things in your life instead of all the negative aspects in your current situation which may be getting you down.<o:p></o:p></font></span></p> <p style="TEXT-ALIGN: left; LINE-HEIGHT: 150%; MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto" class="MsoNormal" align="left"> <b><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'" lang="EN-US"><font size="2">Realize Every Problem Can Be Accepted or Dealt With</font></span></b><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'" lang="EN-US"><br> <br> <font size="2">I came across an interesting concept recently by one of my favorite teachers who said &quot;problems are only memories&quot; and that saying actually became the basis for an article I wrote. To make things a little more understandable, my saying is this:  there is no problem that you have which can't either be dealt with or accepted. Every single problem will fit under one of those two options.<o:p></o:p></font></span></p> <p style="TEXT-ALIGN: left; LINE-HEIGHT: 150%; MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto" class="MsoNormal" align="left"> <span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'" lang="EN-US"><font size="2">&quot;But I don't want to accept the things I cannot change&quot; is a response I received from a lot of people when first mentioning this idea. &quot;OK, so you are going to get angry, cry and stress  yourself out about something that...you can't do anything about?&quot; - It just doesn't make any sense. If you can change something you don't like then by all means work towards doing that, but otherwise accept what is and focus on other things that matter to  you.<o:p></o:p></font></span></p> <p style="TEXT-ALIGN: left; LINE-HEIGHT: 150%; MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto" class="MsoNormal" align="left"> <b><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'" lang="EN-US"><font size="2">Set Yourself a Long Term Goal You Can Be Passionate About</font></span></b><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'" lang="EN-US"><br> <br> <font size="2">I've worked hard with my online properties in the last few years and was lucky enough to be able to quit my job at the beginning of this year to work for myself full-time. I've noticed that now I'm at this stage I literally jump out of bed in  the mornings excited to work on the projects that I have a real passion for. I've come to realize that it doesn't take quitting your job in order to be excited about waking up in the mornings; you just need something you can focus on that you are passionate  about.<o:p></o:p></font></span></p> <p style="TEXT-ALIGN: left; LINE-HEIGHT: 150%; MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto" class="MsoNormal" align="left"> <span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'" lang="EN-US"><font size="2">Maybe you want to lose weight, maybe you want to learn a new language or even learn to play an instrument. Pick a long-term goal that you can give some time regularly, something that  really matters to you. The most important aspect to making this work in your favor is by opening your life up to being able to work on the things you enjoy. After-all, this is a goal you WANT to achieve and it is something you really CARE about.<o:p></o:p></font></span></p> <p style="TEXT-ALIGN: left; LINE-HEIGHT: 150%; MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto" class="MsoNormal" align="left"> <span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'" lang="EN-US"><font size="2">What could be a better way to spend your time?<o:p></o:p></font></span></p> </font></div> </div> </div>
