  <div><DIV>  <P><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">One windy spring day, I observed young people   having fun using the wind to fly their kites. Multicolored creations of varying   shapes and sizes filled the skies like beautiful birds darting and dancing. As   the strong winds gusted against the kites, a string kept them in   check.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">Instead of blowing away with the wind, they arose   against it to achieve great heights. They shook and pulled, but the restraining   string and the cumbersome tail kept them in tow, facing upward and against the   wind. As the kites struggled and trembled against the string, they seemed to   say, "Let me go! Let me go! I want to be free!" They soared beautifully even as   they fought the restriction of the string. Finally, one of the kites succeeded   in breaking loose. "Free at last," it seemed to say. "Free to fly with the   wind."<IMG border=0 hspace=0 align=right   src="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/language_tips/att/site1/20070628/xin_41060428194125952848.jpg"   zmxid="zoomXimageId7" md5=""></FONT></P>  <P><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">Yet freedom from restraint simply put it at the   mercy of an unsympathetic breeze. It fluttered ungracefully to the ground and   landed in a tangled mass of weeds and string against a dead bush. "Free at last"   free to lie powerless in the dirt, to be blown helplessly along the ground, and   to lodge lifeless against the first obstruction.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">How much like kites we sometimes are. The Heaven   gives us adversity and restrictions, rules to follow from which we can grow and   gain strength. Restraint is a necessary counterpart to the winds of opposition.   Some of us tug at the rules so hard that we never soar to reach the heights we   might have obtained. We keep part of the commandment and never rise high enough   to get our tails off the ground.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">Let us each rise to the great heights, recognizing   that some of the restraints that we may chafe under are actually the steadying   force that helps us ascend and achieve.<BR></FONT></P></DIV></div>
