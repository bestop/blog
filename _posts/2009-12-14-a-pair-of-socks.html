  <div class="post"><h2>{{ page.title }}</h2><strong>{{ page.date | date_to_long_string }}</strong><div><FONT face=Arial>One fine afternoon I was walking along   Fifth Avenue, when I remembered that it was necessary to buy a pair of socks. I   turned into the first sock shop that caught my eye, and a boy clerk who could   not have been more than seventeen years old came forward. "What can I do for   you, sir?" "I wish to buy a pair of socks." His eyes glowed. There was a note of   passion in his voice. "Did you know that you had come into the finest place in   the world to buy socks?" I had not been aware of that, as my entrance had been   accidental. "Come with me," said the boy, ecstatically. I followed him to the   rear of the shop, and he began to haul down from the shelves box after box,   displaying their contents for my delectation. <BR><BR>"Hold on, lad, I am going   to buy only one pair!" "I know that," said he, "but I want you to see how   marvelously beautiful these are. Aren't they wonderful?" There was on his face   an expression of solemn and holy rapture, as if he were revealing to me the   mysteries of his religion. I became far more interested in him than in the   socks. I looked at him in amazement. "My friend," said I, "if you can keep this   up, if this is not merely the enthusiasm that comes from novelty, from having a   new job, if you can keep up this zeal and excitement day after day, in ten years   you will own every sock in the United States." <BR><BR>My amazement at his pride   and joy in salesmanship will be easily understood by all who read this article.   In many shops the customer has to wait for someone to wait upon him. And when   finally some clerk does deign to notice you, you are made to feel as if you were   interrupting him. Either he is absorbed in profound thought in which he hates to   be disturbed or he is skylarking with a girl clerk and you feel like apologizing   for thrusting yourself into such intimacy. <BR><BR>He displays no interest   either in you or in the goods he is paid to sell. Yet possibly that very clerk   who is now so apathetic began his career with hope and enthusiasm. The daily   grind was too much for him; the novelty wore off; his only pleasures were found   outside of working hours. He became a mechanical, not inspired, salesman. After   being mechanical, he became incompetent; then he saw younger clerks who had more   zest in their work, promoted over him. He became sour. That was the last stage.   His usefulness was over. <BR><BR>I have observed this melancholy decline in the   lives of so many men in so many occupations that I have come to the conclusion   that the surest road to failure is to do things mechanically. There are many   teachers in schools and colleges who seem duller than the dullest of their   pupils; they go through the motions of teaching, but they are as impersonal as a   telephone.</FONT>  <DIV><FONT size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV></div>
