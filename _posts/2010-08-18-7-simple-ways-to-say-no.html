After I began to say no to others, I realized it&#8217;s really not as bad as I thought. The other people were very understanding and didn&#8217;t put up any resistance. Really, the fears of saying no are just in our mind.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=MsoNormal align=left style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto;text-align:left'><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"'>If you are not sure how to do so, here are 7 simple ways for you to say no. Use the method that best meets your needs in the situation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=MsoNormal align=left style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto;text-align:left'><b><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"'>1. &#8220;I can&#8217;t commit to this as I have other priorities at the moment.&#8221;</span></b><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"'><o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=MsoNormal align=left style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto;text-align:left'><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"'>If you are too busy to engage in the request/offer, this will be applicable. This lets the person know your plate is full at the moment, so he/she should hold off on this as well as future requests. If it makes it easier, you can also share what you&#8217;re working on so the person can understand better. I use this when I have too many commitments to attend to.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=MsoNormal align=left style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto;text-align:left'><b><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"'>2. &#8220;Now&#8217;s not a good time as I&#8217;m in the middle of something. How about we reconnect at X time?&#8221;</span></b><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'><o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=MsoNormal align=left style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto;text-align:left'><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"'>It&#8217;s common to get sudden requests for help when you are in the middle of something. Sometimes I get phone calls from friends or associates when I&#8217;m in a meeting or doing important work. This method is a great way to (temporarily) hold off the request. First, you let the person know it&#8217;s not a good time as you are doing something. Secondly, you make known your desire to help by suggesting another time (at your convenience). This way, the person doesn&#8217;t feel blown off.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=MsoNormal align=left style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto;text-align:left'><b><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"'>3. &#8220;I&#8217;d love to do this, but &#8230;&#8221;</span></b><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'><o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=MsoNormal align=left style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto;text-align:left'><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"'>I often use this as it&#8217;s a gentle way of breaking no to the other party. It&#8217;s encouraging as it lets the person know you like the idea (of course, only say this if you do like it) and there&#8217;s nothing wrong about it. I often get collaboration proposals from fellow bloggers and business associates which I can&#8217;t participate in and I use this method to gently say no. Their ideas are absolutely great, but I can&#8217;t take part due to other reasons such as prior commitments (#1) or different needs (#5).<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=MsoNormal align=left style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto;text-align:left'><b><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"'>4. &#8220;Let me think about it first and I&#8217;ll get back to you.&#8221;</span></b><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'><o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=MsoNormal align=left style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto;text-align:left'><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"'>This is more like a &#8220;Maybe&#8221; than a straight out &#8220;No&#8221;. If you are interested but you don&#8217;t want to say &#8216;yes&#8217; just yet, use this. Sometimes I&#8217;m pitched a great idea which meets my needs, but I want to hold off on committing as I want some time to think first. There are times when new considerations pop in and I want to be certain of the decision before committing myself. If the person is sincere about the request, he/she will be more than happy to wait a short while. Specify a date / time-range (say, in 1-2 weeks) where the person can expect a reply.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=MsoNormal align=left style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto;text-align:left'><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"'>If you&#8217;re not interested in what the person has to offer at all, don&#8217;t lead him/her on. Use methods #5, #6 or #7 which are definitive.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=MsoNormal align=left style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto;text-align:left'><b><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"'>5. &#8220;This doesn&#8217;t meet my needs now but I&#8217;ll be sure to keep you in mind.&#8221;</span></b><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt; font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'><o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=MsoNormal align=left style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto;text-align:left'><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"'>If someone is pitching a deal/opportunity which isn&#8217;t what you are looking for, let him/her know straight-out that it doesn&#8217;t meet your needs. Otherwise, the discussion can drag on longer than it should. It helps as the person know it&#8217;s nothing wrong about what he/she is offering, but that you are looking for something else. At the same time, by saying you&#8217;ll keep him/her in mind, it signals you are open to future opportunities.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=MsoNormal align=left style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto;text-align:left'><b><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"'>6. &#8220;I&#8217;m not the best person to help on this.

If possible, refer them to a lead they can follow-up on &#8211; whether it&#8217;s someone you know, someone who might know someone else, or even a department. I always make it a point to offer an alternate contact so the person doesn&#8217;t end up in a dead end. This way you help steer the person in the right place.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=MsoNormal align=left style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto;text-align:left'><b><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"'>7. &#8220;No, I can&#8217;t.&#8221;</span></b><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'><o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=MsoNormal align=left style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto;text-align:left'><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"'>The simplest and most direct way to say no. We build up too many barriers in our mind to saying no. As I shared earlier in this article, these barriers are self-created and they are not true at all. Don&#8217;t think so much about saying no and just say it outright. You&#8217;ll be surprised when the reception isn&#8217;t half as bad as what you imagined it to be.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=MsoNormal align=left style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto;text-align:left'><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"'>Learn to say no to requests that don&#8217;t meet your needs, and once you do that you&#8217;ll find how easy it actually is. You&#8217;ll get more time for yourself, your work and things that are most important to you. I know I do and I&#8217;m happy I started doing that.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>From: http://celestinechua.com/blog/<o:p></o:p></span></p>  </div>  </div>
