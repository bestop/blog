Because about a year ago, when I was working on my second e-book, I realized that just working on it and releasing it when it was done would not work. Because I could always find stuff to add to it. So I had to set a deadline. Setting a   deadline gave me a kick in the butt and it is generally good way to help you to let go of a need to polish things a bit too much.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:15.0pt;text-indent:-.25in;line-height:19.5pt;mso-list:l2 level1 lfo2;background:white">  <![if !supportLists]><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Wingdings;color:#111111"><span style="mso-list:Ignore">§<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;  </span></span></span><![endif]><b><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;color:#111111">Realize what it costs you when you buy into myths of perfection.</span></b><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;color:#111111">This   was a very powerful reason for me to let go of perfectionism and one I tell myself still if I find thoughts of perfection pop up in my mind. By watching too many movies, listening to too many songs and just taking in what the world is telling you it is very   easy to be lulled into dreams of perfection. It sounds so good and wonderful and you want it.<br>  But in real life it clashes with reality and tends to cause much suffering and stress within you and in the people around you. It can harm or possibly lead you to end relationships, jobs, projects etc. just because your expectations are out of this world. I   find it very helpful to remind myself of this simple fact.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:19.5pt;background:white"><b><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;color:#111111">2.

Spending much of your time in the future and imagining   how things could go wrong at work, in your relationships and with your health can build into horrifying nightmare scenarios playing over and over in your head.

You compare cars, houses, jobs, shoes, money, relationships,   social popularity and so on. And at the end of the day you pummel your self-esteem to the ground and you create a lot of negative feelings.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:19.5pt;background:white"><b><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;color:#111111">How to overcome this habit:</span></b><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;color:#111111"><o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:15.0pt;line-height:19.5pt;background:white">  <span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;color:#111111">Replace that destructive habit with two other habits.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:15.0pt;text-indent:-.25in;line-height:19.5pt;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo4;background:white">  <![if !supportLists]><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Wingdings;color:#111111"><span style="mso-list:Ignore">§<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;  </span></span></span><![endif]><b><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;color:#111111">Compare yourself to yourself.&nbsp;</span></b><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;color:#111111">First, instead of comparing yourself   to other people create the habit of comparing yourself to yourself. See how much you have grown, what you have achieved and what progress you have made towards your goals.&nbsp;This habit has the benefit of creating gratitude, appreciation and kindness towards   yourself as you observe how far you have come, the obstacles you have overcome and the good stuff you have done.<br>  You feel good about yourself without having to think less of other people.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:15.0pt;text-indent:-.25in;line-height:19.5pt;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo4;background:white">  <![if !supportLists]><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Wingdings;color:#111111"><span style="mso-list:Ignore">§<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;  </span></span></span><![endif]><b><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;color:#111111">Be kind.</span></b><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;color:#111111">&nbsp;In my experience, the way you behave and think towards   others seems to have a big, big effect on how you behave towards yourself and think about yourself. Judge and criticize people more and you tend to judge and criticize yourself more (often almost automatically). Be more kind to other people and help them and   you tend to be more kind and helpful to yourself.<br>  Focus on the positive things in yourself and in the people around you. Appreciate what is positive in yourself and others. This way you become more OK with yourself and the people in your world instead of ranking them and yourself and creating differences in   your mind.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:15.0pt;line-height:19.5pt;background:white">  <span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;color:#111111">And remember, you can&#8217;t win if you keep comparing. Just consciously realizing this can be helpful. No matter what you do you can pretty much always find someone else in the world that   has more than you or are better than you at something.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:19.5pt;background:white"><b><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;color:#111111">5.

One thing that has worked for me is to kick the perfectionism habit. You accept that things and situations will have their upsides and downsides   rather than thinking that all details have to positive and excellent. You accept things as they are. This way you can let go emotionally and mentally of what is negative instead of dwelling on it and making mountains out of molehills.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:15.0pt;line-height:19.5pt;background:white">  <span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;color:#111111">Another thing that works is simply to focus on being constructive. Instead of focusing on dwelling and whining about the negative detail. You can do so by asking better questions.
