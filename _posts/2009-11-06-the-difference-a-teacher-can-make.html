Remarkably, he could read,               yet, in spite of his reading skills, Steve was failing. He had been               failing since first grade, as he was passed on from grade to grade.               Steve was a big boy, looking more like a teenager than a twelve year               old, yet, Steve went unnoticed... until Miss White.</FONT></DIV>              <DIV class=3jineiwen>              <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT size=2               face="Comic Sans MS">Miss White was a smiling, young, beautiful               redhead, and Steve was in love! For the first time in his young               life, he couldn't take his eyes off his teacher; yet, still he               failed. He never did his homework, and he was always in trouble with               Miss White. His heart would break under her sharp words, and when he               was punished for failing to turn in his homework, he felt just               miserable! Still, he did not study.</FONT></P>              <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT size=2 face="Comic Sans MS">In               the middle of the first semester of school, the entire seventh grade               was tested for basic skills. Steve hurried through his tests, and               continued to dream of other things, as the day wore on. His heart               was not in school, but in the woods, where he often escaped alone,               trying to shut out the sights, sounds and smells of his alcoholic               home. No one checked on him to see if he was safe. No one knew he               was gone, because no one was sober enough to care. Oddly, Steve               never missed a day of school.</FONT></P>              <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT size=2               face="Comic Sans MS">One day, Miss White's impatient voice broke               into his daydreams.</FONT></P>              <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT size=2               face="Comic Sans MS">"Steve!!" Startled, he turned to look at               her.</FONT></P>              <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT size=2               face="Comic Sans MS">"Pay attention!"</FONT></P>              <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT size=2               face="Comic Sans MS">Steve locked his gaze on Miss White with               adolescent adoration, as she began to go over the test results for               the seventh grade.</FONT></P>              <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT size=2               face="Comic Sans MS">"You all did pretty well," she told the class,               "except for one boy, and it breaks my heart to tell you this,               but..." She hesitated, pinning Steve to his seat with a sharp stare,               her eyes searching his face.</FONT></P>              <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT size=2               face="Comic Sans MS">"...The smartest boy in the seventh grade is               failing my class!"</FONT></P>              <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT size=2               face="Comic Sans MS">She just stared at Steve, as the class spun               around for a good look. Steve dropped his eyes and carefully               examined his fingertips.</FONT></P>              <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT size=2               face="Comic Sans MS">After that, it was war!! Steve still wouldn't               do his homework. Even as the punishments became more severe, he               remained stubborn.</FONT></P>              <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT size=2               face="Comic Sans MS">"Just try it! ONE WEEK!" He was               unmoved.</FONT></P>              <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT size=2               face="Comic Sans MS">"You're smart enough! You'll see a change!"               Nothing fazed him.</FONT></P>              <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT size=2               face="Comic Sans MS">"Give yourself a chance! Don't give up on your               life!" Nothing.</FONT></P>              <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT size=2               face="Comic Sans MS">"Steve! Please! I care about you!"</FONT></P>              <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT size=2               face="Comic Sans MS">Wow! Suddenly, Steve got it!! Someone cared               about him? Someone, totally unattainable and perfect, CARED ABOUT               HIM??!!</FONT></P>              <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT size=2               face="Comic Sans MS">Steve went home from school, thoughtful, that               afternoon. Walking into the house, he took one look around. Both               parents were passed out, in various stages of undress, and the               stench was overpowering! He, quickly, gathered up his camping gear,               a jar of peanut butter, a loaf of bread, a bottle of water, and this               time...his schoolbooks. Grim faced and determined, he headed for the               woods.</FONT></P>              <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT size=2               face="Comic Sans MS">The following Monday he arrived at school on               time, and he waited for Miss White to enter the classroom. She               walked in, all sparkle and smiles! God, she was beautiful! He               yearned for her smile to turn on him. It did not.</FONT></P>              <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT size=2               face="Comic Sans MS">Miss White, immediately, gave a quiz on the               weekend homework. Steve hurried through the test, and was the first               to hand in his paper. With a look of surprise, Miss White took his               paper. Obviously puzzled, she began to look it over. Steve walked               back to his desk, his heart pounding within his chest. As he sat               down, he couldn't resist another look at the lovely   woman.</FONT></P>              <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT size=2               face="Comic Sans MS">Miss White's face was in total shock! She               glanced up at Steve, then down, then up.</FONT></P>              <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT size=2               face="Comic Sans MS">Suddenly, her face broke into a radiant smile.               The smartest boy in the seventh grade had just passed his first               test!</FONT></P>              <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT size=2               face="Comic Sans MS">From that moment nothing was the same for               Steve. Life at home remained the same, but life still changed. He               discovered that not only could he learn, but he was good at               it!</FONT></P>              <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT size=2 face="Comic Sans MS">He               discovered that he could understand and retain knowledge, and that               he could translate the things he learned into his own life. Steve               began to excel! And he continued this course throughout his school               life.</FONT></P>              <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT size=2               face="Comic Sans MS">After high-school Steve enlisted in the Navy,               and he had a successful military career. During that time, he met               the love of his life, he raised a family, and he graduated from               college Magna Cum Laude. During his Naval career, he inspired many               young people, who without him, might not have believed in               themselves. Steve began a second career after the Navy, and he               continues to inspire others, as an adjunct professor in a nearby               college Miss White left a great legacy. She saved one boy who has               changed many lives.</FONT></P>              <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT size=2               face="Comic Sans MS">You see, it's simple, really. A change took               place within the heart of one boy, all because of one teacher, who               cared.</FONT></P></DIV></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></div>
