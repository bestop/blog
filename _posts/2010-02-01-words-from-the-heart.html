Once in a while, they hear them just in   time.</FONT></DIV>  <DIV class=sanjineiwen>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>I met Connie the day she was   admitted to the hospice ward, where I worked as a volunteer. Her husband, Bill,   stood nervously nearby as she was transferred from the gurney to the hospital   bed. Although Connie was in the final stages of her fight against cancer, she   was alert and cheerful. We got her settled in. I finished marking her name on   all the hospital supplies she would be using, then asked if she needed   anything.</FONT></P>  <P align=right><FONT face=Arial><IMG style="WIDTH: 200px; HEIGHT: 130px"   id=1007185 title="" border=0 alt="Words from the Heart" align=right   src="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/language_tips/book/attachement/jpg/site1/20080918/0013729e42d20a3bffa80e.jpg"   zmxid="zoomXimageId6" md5="" sourcedescription="编辑提供的本地文件"   sourcename="本地文件"></FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial></FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"Oh, yes," she said, "Would you   please show me how to use the TV? I enjoy the soaps so much and I don't want to   get behind on what's happening." Connie was a romantic. She loved soap operas,   romance novels and movies with a good love story. As we became acquainted, she   confided how frustrating it was to be married 32 years to a man who often called   her "a silly woman".</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"Oh, I know Bill loves me," she   said, "but he has never been one to say he loves me, or send cards to me."She   sighed and looked out the window at the trees in the courtyard. "I'd give   anything if he'd say 'I love you,' but it's just not in his nature."</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Bill visited Connie every day.   In the beginning, he sat next to the bed while she watched the soaps. Later,   when she began sleeping more, he paced up and down the hallway outside her room.   Soon, when she no longer watched television and had fewer waking moments, I   began spending more of my volunteer time with Bill.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>He talked about having worked   as a carpenter and how he liked to go fishing. He and Connie had no children,   but they'd been enjoying retirement by traveling, until Connie got sick. Bill   could not express his feelings about the fact that his wife was   dying.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>One day, over coffee in the   cafeteria, I got him on the subject of women and how we need romance in our   lives; how we love to get sentimental1 cards and love letters.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"Do you tell Connie you love   her?" I asked (knowing his answer), and he looked at me as if I was   crazy.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"I don't have to," he said.   "She knows I do!"</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"I'm sure she knows," I said,   reaching over and touching his hands rough, carpenter's hands that were gripping   the cup as if it were the only thing he had to hang onto "but she needs to hear   it, Bill. She needs to hear what she has meant to you all these years. Please   think about it."</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>We walked back to Connie"s   room. Bill disappeared inside, and I left to visit another patient. Later, I saw   Bill sitting by the bed. He was holding Connie's hand as she slept. The date was   February 12.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Two days later I walked down   the hospice ward at noon. There stood Bill, leaning up against the wall in the   hallway, staring at the floor. I already knew from the head nurse that Connie   had died at 11 A.M.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>When Bill saw me, he allowed   himself to come into my arms for a long time. His face was wet with tears and he   was trembling. Finally, he leaned back against the wall and took a deep   breath.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"I have to say something," he   said. "I have to say how good I feel about telling her." He stopped to blow his   nose. "I thought a lot about what you said, and this morning I told her how much   I loved her... and loved being married to her. You should&nbsp;have&nbsp;seen   her smile!"</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>I went into the room to say my   own good bye to Connie. There, on the bedside table, was a large Valentine card   from Bill. You know, the sentimental kind that says, "To my wonderful wife... I   love you."</FONT></P></DIV></DIV></div>
