"Come and play with me ," the tree asked the boy . "I am   no longer a kid,&nbsp;I don't play around trees anymore." The boy replied, "I   want toys.&nbsp;I need money to buy them."</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"Sorry, but&nbsp;I don't have   money…but you can pick all my apples and sell them. So, you will have money."   The boy was so excited. He grabbed all the apples on the tree and left happily.   The boy never came back after he picked the apples.

I&nbsp;have to work for my family. We need a house for shelter. Can you help   me?" "Sorry, but&nbsp;I don't have a house, but you can chop off my branches to   build your house."So the boy cut all the branches of the tree and left   happily."</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>The tree was glad to see him   happy but the boy never came back since then. The tree was again lonely and   sad.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>One hot summer day, the boy   returned and the tree was delighted. "Come and play with me," the tree   said.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"I am sad and getting old. I   want to go sailing to relax myself. Can you give me a boat?"

"I   don't need much now,just a place to rest. I am tired after all these year," the   boy replied.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"Good! Old tree roots is the   best place to lean on and rest.
