One day, on the road, I found the broken   pieces of a mirror. A German motorcycle had been wrecked in that   place.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>"I tried to find all the pieces and put them together, but   it was not possible, so I kept only the largest piece. This one, and, by   scratching it on a stone, I made it round. I began to play with it as a toy and   became fascinated by the fact that I could reflect light into dark places where   the sun would never shine---in deep holes and crevices and dark closets. It   became a game for me to get light into the most inaccessible places I could   find.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>"I kept the little mirror, and, as I went about my growing   up, I would take it out in idle moments and continue the challenge of the game.   As I became a man, I grew to understand that this was not just a child's game   but a metaphor for what I might do with my life. I came to understand that I am   not the light or the source of light. But light---truth, understanding,   knowledge---is there, and it will shine in many dark places only if I reflect   it.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>"I am a fragment of a mirror whose whole design and shape I   do not know. Nevertheless, with what I have I can reflect light into the dark   places of this world---into the black places in the hearts of men---and change   some things in some people. Perhaps others may see and do likewise. This is what   I am about. This is the meaning of my   life."</FONT></P></DIV></DIV></div>
