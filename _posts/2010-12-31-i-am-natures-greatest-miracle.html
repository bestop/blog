None that came before, none that live   today, and none that come tomorrow can walk and talk and move and think exactly   like me. All men are my brothers yet I am different from each. I am a unique   creature.</FONT></P>  <P align=center><FONT face=Arial></FONT>  <CENTER><FONT face=Arial><IMG style="WIDTH: 450px; HEIGHT: 250px" id=3081639   title="" border=0 alt="I am nature's greatest miracle. 我是自然界最伟大的奇迹" align=center   src="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/language_tips/book/attachement/jpg/site1/20100812/0013729e41a90dcdb16d3c.jpg"   md5="" sourcedescription="编辑提供的本地文件" sourcename="本地文件"></FONT></CENTER>  <P><FONT face=Arial></FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>I am   nature's greatest miracle.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Although I   am of the animal kingdom, animal rewards alone will not satisfy me. Within me   burns a flame, which has been passed from generations uncounted and its heat is   a constant irritation to my spirit to become better than I am, and I will. I   will fan this flame of dissatisfaction and proclaim my uniqueness to the   world.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>None can   duplicate my brush strokes, none can make my chisel marks, none can duplicate my   handwriting, none can produce my child, and, in truth, none has the ability to   sell exactly as I. Henceforth, I will capitalize on this difference for it is an   asset to be promoted to the fullest.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>I am   nature's greatest miracle.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Vain   attempts to imitate others no longer will I make. Instead will I place my   uniqueness on display in the market place. I will proclaim it, yea, I will sell   it. I will begin now to accent my differences; hide my similarities. So too will   I apply this principle to the goods I sell. Salesman and goods, different from   all others, and proud of the difference.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>I am a   unique creature of nature.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>I am rare,   and there is value in all rarity; therefore, I am valuable. I am the end product   of thousands of years of evolution; therefore, I am better equipped in both mind   and body than all the emperors and wise men who preceded me.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>But my   skills, my mind, my heart, and my body will stagnate, rot, and die lest I put   them to good use. I have unlimited potential. Only a small portion of my brain   do I employ; only a paltry amount of my muscles do I flex. A hundredfold or more   can I increase my accomplishments of yesterday and this I will do, beginning   today.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Nevermore   will I be satisfied with yesterday's accomplishments nor will I indulge,   anymore, in self-praise for deeds which in reality are too small to even   acknowledge. I can accomplish far more than I have, and I will, for why should   the miracle which produced me end with my birth? Why can I not extend that   miracle to my deeds of today?</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>I am   nature's greatest miracle.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>I am not   on this earth by chance. I am here for a purpose and that purpose is to grow   into a mountain, not to shrink to a grain of sand. Henceforth will I apply all   my efforts to become the highest mountain of all and I will strain my potential   until it cries for mercy.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>I will   increase my knowledge of mankind, myself, and the goods I sell, thus my sales   will multiply. I will practice, and improve, and polish the words I utter to   sell my goods, for this is the foundation on which I will build my career and   never will I forget that many have attained great wealth and success with only   one sales talk, delivered with excellence. Also will I seek constantly to   improve my manners and graces, for they are the sugar to which all are   attracted.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>I am   nature's greatest miracle.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>I will   concentrate my energy on the challenge of the moment and my actions will help me   forget all else. The problems of my home will be left in my home. I will think   naught of my family when I am in the market place for this will cloud my   thoughts. So too will the problems of the market place be left in the market   place and I will think naught of my profession when I am in my home for this   will dampen my love.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>There is   no room in the market place for my family, nor is there room in my home for the   market. Each I will divorce from the other and thus will I remain wedded to   both. Separate must they remain or my career will die. This is a paradox of the   ages.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>I am   nature's greatest miracle.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>I have   been given eyes to see and a mind to think and now I know a great secret of life   for I perceive, at last, that all my problems, discouragements, and heartaches   are, in truth, great opportunities in disguise. I will no longer be fooled by   the garments they wear for mine eyes are open. I will look beyond the cloth and   I will not be deceived.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>I am   nature's greatest miracle.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>No beast,   no plant, no wind, no rain, no rock, no lake had the same beginning as I, for I   was conceived in love and brought forth with a purpose. In the past I have not   considered this fact but it will henceforth shape and guide my life.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>I am   nature's greatest miracle.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>And nature   knows not defeat. Eventually, she emerges victorious and so will I, and with   each victory the next struggle becomes less difficult.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>I will   win, and I will become a great salesman, for I am unique.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>I am   nature's greatest miracle.</FONT></P></DIV></DIV></div>
