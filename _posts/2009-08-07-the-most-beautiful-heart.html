  <div><DIV><FONT size=2>  <P>One day a young man was standing in the middle of the town proclaiming that   he had the most beautiful heart in the whole valley. A large crowd gathered, and   they all admired his heart for it was perfect. There was not a flaw in it.</P>  <P>Suddenly, an old man appeared and said, "Why, your heart is not nearly as   beautiful as mine."</P>  <P>The crowd and the young man looked at the old man's heart. It was full of   scars, it had places where pieces had been removed and other pieces put in, but   they didn't fit quite right, and there were several jagged edges. In fact, in   some places there were deep gouges where whole pieces were missing.</P>  <P>The young man laughed. "Comparing your heart with mine, mine is perfect and   yours is a mess of scars."</P>  <P>"Yes," said the old man, "Yours looks perfect but I would never trade with   you. You see, every scar represents a person to whom I have given my love. I   tear out a piece of my heart and give it to them, and often they give me a piece   of their heart that fits into the empty place in my heart.</P>  <P>But because the pieces aren't exact, I have some rough edges, which I   cherish, because they remind me of the love we shared.</P>  <P>"Sometimes I have given pieces of my heart away, and the other person hasn't   returned a piece of his or her heart to me. These are the empty gouges -- giving   love is taking a chance.</P>  <P>Although these gouges are painful, they stay open, reminding me of the love I   have for those people too, and I hope someday they may return and fill the space   I have waiting. So now do you see what true beauty is?"</P>  <P>The young man walked up to the old man, reached into his perfect heart, and   ripped a piece out. He offered it to the old man.</P>  <P>The old man placed it in his heart, then took a piece from his old scarred   heart and placed it in the wound in the young man's heart. It fit, but not   perfectly, as there were some jagged edges.</P>  <P>The young man looked at his heart, not perfect anymore but more beautiful   than ever, since love from the old man's heart flowed into his.</P>  <P>They embraced and walked away side by side.</P></FONT></DIV></div>
