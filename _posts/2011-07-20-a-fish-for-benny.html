  <div><div class="sanjiriqi"><span style="font-family:Arial;">"Rats!" I groaned. "Is he coming along?"</span></div><br /><div class="sanjineiwen"><br /><p><span style="font-family:Arial;">I stared disgustedly at my new stepbrother, Benny, sitting in the back seat of Dad's car. Benny is eight, short and thin with beady eyes and big ears. Now that Mom and Dad are divorced, I only see Dad every other weekend, and Benny is always horning in. He ruins everything.</span></p><br /><p><span style="font-family:Arial;">The time we went hiking, he got a blister. The zoo made him sneeze. At the baseball game he got a peanut up his nose. If Dad had to remarry, I don't see why he picked Benny's mother. I mean, she's OK. It's just too bad that Benny was included in the deal.</span></p><br /><p><span style="font-family:Arial;">Today Dad and I were going deep-sea fishing for the first time. Now it was spoiled.</span></p><br /><p><span style="font-family:Arial;">"Joe," Dad said in his patient voice, "Benny's your brother―"</span></p><br /><p><span style="font-family:Arial;">"Some brother!"</span></p><br /><p align="left"><span style="font-family:Arial;"><img style="WIDTH: 324px; HEIGHT: 251px" id="3782433" title="" border="0" alt="班尼的鱼 A Fish for Benny" align="right" src="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/language_tips/book/attachement/jpg/site1/20110509/0023ae731d750f31edf104.jpg" sourcename="本地文件" sourcedescription="编辑提供的本地文件" md5="" /></span></p><br /><p><span style="font-family:Arial;">"We'll have a good time," Dad promised. "Better bring a jacket."</span></p><br /><p><span style="font-family:Arial;">"What for?" I glanced at the steel-colored Florida sky. "It's hot today."</span></p><br /><p><span style="font-family:Arial;">The fishing boat was a scabby old tub, but when you're only paying 15 dollars a person for three hours of fishing, you don't get the <em>Queen Elizabeth II</em>. There were several people on board, sitting on benches on each side of the deck. A few were in the cabin.</span></p><br /><p><span style="font-family:Arial;">The captain's mate gave each of us a rod and reel and a bucket of bait before we cast off.</span></p><br /><p><span style="font-family:Arial;">"We're making up a jackpot for whoever catches the biggest fish," the mate said. "If you guys want in on it, it will cost you a buck a piece."</span></p><br /><p><span style="font-family:Arial;">Dad gave him three dollars. I figured paying for Benny was wasted money. He probably wouldn't even bait his hook.</span></p><br /><p><span style="font-family:Arial;">I was right. The kid stared suspiciously into the bucket and made a face.</span></p><br /><p><span style="font-family:Arial;">"This stuff stinks! What is it?"</span></p><br /><p><span style="font-family:Arial;">"Dead fish," I told him.</span></p><br /><p><span style="font-family:Arial;">"Do I have to touch it?"</span></p><br /><p><span style="font-family:Arial;">"If you want to bait your hook, you do."</span></p><br /><p><span style="font-family:Arial;">"Here, Benny," Dad said, "take my rod. The hook's baited and in the water. I'll use yours."</span></p><br /><p><span style="font-family:Arial;">"OK!" said Benny. He gripped the handle of the rod as if his life depended on it.</span></p><br /><p><span style="font-family:Arial;">A breeze had sprung up, and the waves were choppy. Some clouds slid over the sun. Nobody caught anything.</span></p><br /><p><span style="font-family:Arial;">Then Benny said, "Something's jerking my line. What should I do?"</span></p><br /><p><span style="font-family:Arial;">"Jerk back!" I told him. I reached for his rod. "I'll get it for you!"</span></p><br /><p><span style="font-family:Arial;">"Let him do it, Joe," Dad said. "Pull, Benny, and hang on tight!"</span></p><br /><p><span style="font-family:Arial;">Wouldn't you know it? Benny caught the first fish―ttle snapper―and he acted as if it were a prize marlin.</span></p><br /><p><span style="font-family:Arial;">Meanwhile the sky had grown dark, and the breeze had turned into a stiff wind, The waves rose higher. Drops of rain slapped our faces, the temperature dropped, and thunder rumbled in the distance. The boat rocked like a runaway cradle.</span></p><br /><p><span style="font-family:Arial;">Dad's face turned green.</span></p><br /><p><span style="font-family:Arial;">"I think I'll go below," he said as he handed me his rod. "Look after Benny."</span></p><br /><p><span style="font-family:Arial;">He staggered across the deck and bent over the rail.</span></p><br /><p><span style="font-family:Arial;">I had expected Benny to get seasick, but not Dad. Well, the kid would probably be next.</span></p><br /><p><span style="font-family:Arial;">The waves were really high now. One second the boat seemed to be standing on a hilltop, and the next it would plunge into a valley. I clung to the rail and watched the waves rise and fall.</span></p><br /><p><span style="font-family:Arial;">My stomach suddenly heaved, and a bitter taste rose into my throat. I leaned over the rail and lost my lunch. I'd never been so sick in all my life―and I was freezing! Goosebumps stood out on my arms like grapefruits. Why hadn't I worn a jacket? Why had I even come? Who needed to go deep-sea fishing anyway? I suddenly realized I hated fish―especially the dead ones in the bait buckets. The stink of them filled my nose, my head―my stomach! Breakfast followed lunch.</span></p><br /><p><span style="font-family:Arial;">"Maybe you'd better go inside the cabin, Joe," said Benny. "I'll help you."</span></p><br /><p><span style="font-family:Arial;">"I don't need any help!"</span></p><br /><p><span style="font-family:Arial;">But I did. I was so weak my legs trembled. I could never have crossed that squirming deck if Benny hadn't supported me. The kid was stronger than he looked. He helped me down the steps and steered me to the bench where Dad was sitting with his head drooping on his chest.</span></p><br /><p><span style="font-family:Arial;">Dad briefly stared at us with bleary eyes before closing them again. I knew just how he felt.</span></p><br /><p><span style="font-family:Arial;">It was warmer in the cabin, but I kept shivering while I tried to keep my stomach from crawling into my mouth.</span></p><br /><p><span style="font-family:Arial;">Benny took off his windbreaker and draped it over my shoulders. "You'd better lie down on the bench and put your head on my lap," he said.</span></p><br /><p><span style="font-family:Arial;">I lay there for the rest of that miserable voyage. When I finally tottered off the boat, I said I'd never step off solid ground again. Dad said he felt the same way.</span></p><br /><p><span style="font-family:Arial;">I thanked Benny for his jacket―and for his skinny thighs, which had made a pillow for my woozy head.</span></p><br /><p><span style="font-family:Arial;">"No problem!" Benny grinned. "What are brothers for?"</span></p><br /><p><span style="font-family:Arial;">"To make money!" I pointed at the bundle of dollar bills he was carrying. Because of the storm, nobody else had caught a fish, so Benny had won the jackpot.</span></p><br /><p><span style="font-family:Arial;">He deserved it.</span></p></div></div>
