I had one last patient to see. I approached her room in a hurry and   stood at the doorway. She was an older woman, sitting at the edge of the bed,   struggling to put socks on her swollen feet. I crossed the threshold, spoke   quickly to the nurse, scanned her chart noting she was in stable condition. I   was almost in the clear.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -1.5pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>I leaned   on the bedrail looking down at her. She asked if I could help put on her socks.   Instead, I launched into a monologue that went something like this: "How are you   feeling? Your sugars and blood pressure were high but they're better today. The   nurse mentioned you're anxious to see your son who's visiting you today. It's   nice to have family visit from far away. I bet you really look forward to seeing   him."</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -1.5pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>She   stopped me with a stern, authoritative voice. "Sit down, doctor. This is my   story, not your story."</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -1.5pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>I was   surprised and embarrassed. I sat down. I helped her with the socks. She began to   tell me that her only son lived around the corner from her, but she had not seen   him in five years. She believed that the stress of this contributed greatly to   her health problems. After hearing her story and putting on her socks, I asked   if there was anything else I could do for her. She shook her head no and smiled.   All she wanted me to do was to listen.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -1.5pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Each story   is different. Some are detailed; others are vague. Some have a beginning, middle   and end. Others wander without a clear conclusion. Some are true; others not.   Yet all those things do not really matter. What matters to the storyteller is   that the story is heard ― without interruption, assumption or   judgment.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -1.5pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Listening   to someone's story costs less than expensive diagnostic testing but is key to   healing and diagnosis.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -1.5pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>I often   thought of what that woman taught me, and I reminded myself of the importance of   stopping, sitting down and truly listening. And, not long after, in an   unexpected twist, I became the patient, with a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis   at age 31. Now, 20 years later, I sit all the time ― in a wheelchair.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -1.5pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>For as   long as I could, I continued to see patients from my chair, but I had to resign   when my hands were affected. I still teach med students and other health care   professionals, but now from the perspective of physician and patient.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -1.5pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>I tell   them I believe in the power of listening. I tell them I know firsthand that   immeasurable healing takes place within me when someone stops, sits down and   listens to my story.</FONT></P></DIV></DIV></div>
