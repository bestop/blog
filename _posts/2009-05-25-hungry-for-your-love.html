  <div><DIV><FONT   size=2>我的心跳急剧加速，我径直地看着拉玛的眼睛，问她，"那个男孩是不是有一天告诉你，'明天不要给我送苹果了，我要被送到另一个集中营了'？" <BR>　　   <BR>　　"对呀，你怎么知道的。"拉玛的声音有点颤抖，"告诉我，赫尔曼，你到底是怎么知道的啊？" <BR>　　   <BR>　　我抓住她的手说，"因为我就是那个男孩啊，拉玛。"透过时间的面纱，我们认出了那藏在眼睛深处的灵魂，那是我们永远也无法停止爱恋的亲人。最后，我说："拉玛，我再也不想和你分开了。我想要永远和你在一起。亲爱的，你能嫁给我吗？"   <BR>　　 <BR>　　It is cold, so bitter cold, on this dark, winter day in 1942. But   it is no different from any other day in this Nazi concentration camp. I stand   shivering in my thin rags, still in disbelief that this nightmare is happening.   I am just a young boy. I should be playing with friends; I should be going to   school; I should be looking forward to a future, to growing up and marrying, and   having a family of my own. But those dreams are for the living, and I am no   longer one of them. Instead, I am almost dead, surviving from day to day, from   hour to hour, ever since I was taken from my home and brought here with tens of   thousands other Jews. Will I still be alive tomorrow? Will I be taken to the gas   chamber tonight? <BR>　　 <BR>　　 <BR>　　Back and forth I walk next to the barbed   wire fence, trying to keep my emaciated body warm. I am hungry, but I have been   hungry for longer than I want to remember. I am always hungry. Edible food seems   like a dream. Each day as more of us disappear, the happy past seems like a mere   dream, and I sink deeper and deeper into despair. Suddenly, I notice a young   girl walking past on the other side of the barbed wire. She stops and looks at   me with sad eyes, eyes that seem to say that she understands, that she, too,   cannot fathom why I am here. I want to look away, oddly ashamed for this   stranger to see me like this, but I cannot tear my eyes from hers. <BR>　　   <BR>　　Then she reaches into her pocket, and pulls out a red apple. A beautiful,   shiny red apple. Oh, how long has it been since I have seen one! She looks   cautiously to the left and to the right, and then with a smile of triumph,   quickly throws the apple over the fence. I run to pick it up, holding it in my   trembling, frozen fingers. In my world of death, this apple is an expression of   life, of love. I glance up in time to see the girl disappearing into the   distance. <BR>　　 <BR>　　The next day, I cannot help myself-I am drawn at the same   time to that spot near the fence. Am I crazy for hoping she will come again? Of   course. But in here, I cling to any tiny scrap of hope. She has given me hope   and I must hold tightly to it. <BR>　　 <BR>　　And again, she comes. And again, she   brings me an apple, flinging it over the fence with that same sweet smile.   <BR>　　 <BR>　　This time I catch it, and hold it up for her to see. Her eyes   twinkle. Does she pity me? Perhaps. I do not care, though. I am just so happy to   gaze at her. And for the first time in so long, I feel my heart move with   emotion. <BR>　　 <BR>　　For seven months, we meet like this. Sometimes we exchange   a few words. Sometimes, just an apple. But she is feeding more than my belly,   this angel from heaven. She is feeding my soul. And somehow, I know I am feeding   hers as well. <BR>　　 <BR>　　One day, I hear frightening news: we are being   shipped to another camp. This could mean the end for me. And it definitely means   the end for me and my friend. The next day when I greet her, my heart is   breaking, and I can barely speak as I say what must be said: "Do not bring me an   apple tomorrow," I tell her. "I am being sent to another camp. We will never see   each other again." Turning before I lose all control, I run away from the fence.   I cannot bear to look back. If I did, I know she would see me standing there,   with tears streaming down my face. <BR>　　 <BR>　　Months pass and the nightmare   continues. But the memory of this girl sustains me through the terror, the pain,   the hopelessness. Over and over in my mind, I see her face, her kind eyes, I   hear her gentle words, I taste those apples. <BR>　　 <BR>　　And then one day, just   like that, the nightmare is over. The war has ended. Those of us who are still   alive are freed. I have lost everything that was precious to me, including my   family. But I still have the memory of this girl, a memory I carry in my heart   and gives me the will to go on as I move to America to start a new life. Years   pass. It is 1957. I am living in New York City. A friend convinces me to go on a   blind date with a lady friend of his. Reluctantly, I agree. But she is nice,   this woman named Roma. And like me, she is an immigrant, so we have at least   that in common. <BR>　　 <BR>　　"Where were you during the war?" Roma asks me   gently, in that delicate way immigrants ask one another questions about those   years. <BR>　　 <BR>　　"I was in a concentration camp in Germany," I reply. <BR>　　   <BR>　　Roma gets a far away look in her eyes, as if she is remembering something   painful yet sweet. <BR>　　 <BR>　　"What is it?" I ask. <BR>　　 <BR>　　"I am just   thinking about something from my past, Herman," Roma explains in a voice   suddenly very soft. "You see, when I was a young girl, I lived near a   concentration camp. There was a boy there, a prisoner, and for a long while, I   used to visit him every day. I remember I used to bring him apples. I would   throw the apple over the fence, and he would be so happy." <BR>　　 <BR>　　Roma   sighs heavily and continues. "It is hard to describe how we felt about each   other-after all, we were young, and we only exchanged a few words when we   could-but I can tell you, there was much love there. I assume he was killed like   so many others. But I cannot bear to think that, and so I try to remember him as   he was for those months we were given together." <BR>　　 <BR>　　With my heart   pounding so loudly I think it wil1 explode, I look directly at Roma and ask,   "And did that boy say to you one day, 'Do not bring me an apple tomorrow. I am   being sent to another camp'?" <BR>　　 <BR>　　"Why, yes," Roma responds, her voice   trembling. <BR>　　 <BR>　　"But, Herman, how on earth could you possibly know   that?" <BR>　　 <BR>　　I take her hands in mine and answer, "Because I was that   young boy, Roma." <BR>　　 <BR>　　For many moments, there is only silence. We   cannot take our eyes from each other, and as the veils of time lift, we   recognize the soul behind the eyes, the dear friend we once loved so much, whom   we have never stopped loving, whom we have never stopped remembering. <BR>　　   <BR>　　Finally, I speak: "Look, Roma, I was separated from you once, and I don't   ever want to be separated from you again. Now, I am free, and I want to be   together with you forever. Dear, will you marry me?" <BR>　　 <BR>　　I see that   same twinkle in her eye that I used to see as Roma says, "Yes, I will marry   you," and we embrace, the embrace we longed to share for so many months, but   barbed wire came between us. Now, nothing ever will again. <BR>　　 <BR>　　Almost   forty years have passed since that day when I found my Roma again. Destiny   brought us together the first time during the war to show me a promise of hope   and now it had reunited us to fulfill that promise. <BR>　　 <BR>　　Valentine's   Day, 1996. I bring Roma to the Oprah Winfrey Show to honor her on national   television. I want to tell her in front of millions of people what I feel in my   heart every day: <BR>　　 <BR>　　"Darling, you fed me in the concentration camp   when I was hungry. And I am still hungry, for something I will never get enough   of: I am only hungry for your love." <BR></FONT></DIV></div>
