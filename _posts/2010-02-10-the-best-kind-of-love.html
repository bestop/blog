  <div><DIV>  <DIV class=sanjiriqi><FONT face=Arial>I have a friend who is falling in love.   She honestly claims the sky is bluer. Mozart moves her to tears. She has lost 15   pounds and looks like a cover girl.</FONT></DIV>  <DIV class=sanjineiwen>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"I'm young again!" she shouts   exuberantly.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>As my friend raves on about her   new love, I've taken a good look at my old one. My husband of almost 20 years,   Scott, has gained 15 pounds. Once a marathon runner, he now runs only down   hospital halls. His hairline is receding and his body shows the signs of long   working hours and too many candy bars. Yet he can still give me a certain look   across a restaurant table and I want to ask for the check and head   home.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>When my friend asked me "What   will make this love last?" I ran through all the obvious reasons: commitment,   shared interests, unselfishness, physical attraction, communication. Yet there's   more. We still have fun. Spontaneous good times. Yesterday, after slipping the   rubber band off the rolled up newspaper, Scott flipped it playfully at me: this   led to an all-out war. Last Saturday at the grocery, we split the list and raced   each other to see who could make it to the checkout first. Even washing dishes   can be a blast. We enjoy simply being together.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>And there are surprises. One   time I came home to find a note on the front door that led me to another note,   then another, until I reached the walk-in closet. I opened the door to find   Scott holding a "pot of gold" (my cooking kettle) and the "treasure" of a gift   package. Sometimes I leave him notes on the mirror and little presents under his   pillow.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>There is understanding. I   understand why he must play basketball with the guys. And he understands why,   once a year, I must get away from the house, the kids -and even him -to meet my   sisters for a few days of nonstop talking and laughing.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>There is sharing. Not only do   we share household worries and parental burdens Ôºç we also share ideas. Scott   came home from a convention last month and presented me with a thick historical   novel. Though he prefers thrillers and science fiction, he had read the novel on   the plane. He touched my heart when he explained it was because he wanted to be   able to exchange ideas about the book after I'd read it.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>There is forgiveness. When I'm   embarrasssingly loud and crazy at parties, Scott forgives me. When he confessed   losing some of our savings in the stock market, I gave him a hug and said, "It's   okay. It's only money."</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>There is sensitivity. Last week   he walked through the door with that look that tells me it's been a tough day.   After he spent some time with the kids, I asked him what happened. He told me   about a 60-year-old woman who'd had a stroke. He wept as he recalled the woman's   husband standing beside her bed, caressing her hand. How was he going to tell   this husband of 40 years that his wife would probably never recover? I shed a   few tears myself. Because of the medical crisis. Because there were still people   who have been married 40 years. Because my husband is still moved and concerned   after years of hospital rooms and dying patients.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>There is faith. Last Tuesday a   friend came over and confessed her fear that her husband is losing his   courageous battle with cancer. On Wednesday I went to lunch with a friend who is   struggling to reshape her life after divorce. On Thursday a neighbor called to   talk about the frightening effects of Alzheimer's disease on her father-in-law's   personality. On Friday a childhood friend called long-distance to tell me her   father had died. I hung up the phone and thought, this is too much heartache for   one week. Through my tears, as I went out to run some errands, I noticed the   boisterous orange blossoms of the gladiolus outside my window. I heard the   delighted laughter of my son and his friend as they played. I caught sight of a   wedding party emerging from a neighbor's house. The bride, dressed in satin and   lace, tossed her bouquet to her cheering friends. That night, I told my husband   about these events. We helped each other acknowledge the cycles of life and that   the joys counter the sorrows. It was enough to keep us going.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Finally, there is knowing. I   know Scott will throw his laundry just shy of the hamper every night; he'll be   late to most appointments and eat the last chocolate in the box. He knows that I   sleep with a pillow over my head; I'll lock us out of the house at a regular   basis, and I will also eat the last chocolate.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>I guess our love lasts because   it is comfortable. No, the sky is not bluer: it's just a familiar hue. We don't   feel particularly young: we've experienced too much that has contributed to our   growth and wisdom, taking its toll on our bodies, and created our   memories.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>I hope we've got what it takes   to make our love last. As a bride, I had Scott's wedding band engraved with   Robert Browning's line "Grow old along with me!" We're following those   instructions.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"If anything is real, the heart   will make it plain."</FONT></P></DIV></DIV></div>
