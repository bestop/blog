  <div><DIV><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">  <P>Imagine life as a game in which you are juggling five balls in the air. You   name them: work, family, health, friends, and spirit, and you're keeping all of   them in the air. You will soon understand that work is a rubber ball. If you   drop it, it will bounce back. But the other four balls--family, health, friends,   and spirit are made of glass. If you drop one of these, they will be irrevocably   scuffed, marked, nicked, damaged, or even shattered. They will never be the   same. You must understand that and strive for balance in your life.<BR><BR>How?   Don't undermine your worth by comparing yourself with others. It is because we   are different that each of us is special. Don't set your goals by what other   people deem important. Only you know what is best for you. Don't take for   granted the things closest to your heart. Cling to them as you would your life,   for without them, life is meaningless. Don't le t life slip through your fingers   by living in the past or for the future. By living your life one day at a time   you live ALL the days of your life. Don't give up when you still have<IMG   border=0 hspace=5 vspace=5 align=right   src="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/language_tips/att/site1/20070625/xin_07060425195431186756.jpg"   zmxid="zoomXimageId7" md5="">something to give. Nothing is really over until the   moment you stop trying. Don't be afraid to admit that you are less than perfect.   It is this fragile thread that binds us together. Don't be afraid to encounter   risks. It is by taking chances that we learn to be brave. Don't shut love out of   your life by saying it's impossible to find. The quickest way to receive love is   to give; the fastest way to lose love is to hold it too tightly; and the best   way to keep love is to give it wings. Don't run thruogh life so fast that you   forget not only where you've been, but also where you are going. Don't forget   that a person's greatest emotional need is to feel appreciated. Don't use time   or words carelessly. Neither can be retrieved. Life is not a race, but a journey   to be savored each step of the way.<BR></P></FONT></DIV></div>
