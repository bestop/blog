It would be   a good workout and it would be good to be together.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -1.5pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>We planned   to leave immediately after lunch. I noticed Daniel, who will be ten in November,   and Wes, who will be seven in December, scramble for their gear. They had spent   the morning pouring over outdoor outfitter catalogs looking at sophisticated   equipment that would be sufficient to thru-hike the Appalachian   Trail.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -1.5pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>I thought   back over the years to the hours I spent with my official Boy Scout handbook. I   was disgusted to remember that I spent more time reading about nature than I   spent experiencing it. That's when I said, "Guys, let's just use the daypacks we   have and take a nice hike this afternoon." They say the smallest deed is better   than the grandest intention. The boys heartily agreed.</FONT></P>  <P align=right><FONT face=Arial><IMG   style="BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 0px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 0px solid; BORDER-TOP: #000000 0px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 0px solid"   id=3150289 title="" border=0 alt="Hit the trail 儿子的"计算器"" align=right   src="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/language_tips/book/attachement/jpg/site1/20100902/0013729e41a90de992ef37.jpg"   width=314 height=251 md5="" sourcedescription="编辑提供的本地文件"   sourcename="本地文件"></FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -1.5pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT   face=Arial>Immediately after lunch we made for the trailhead. Chuck joined us   and led the expedition. The little guys fell in on the trail ahead of me with   their full daypacks, slouch hats, and bottles filled with water. They soon found   walking sticks. I laughed as I watched Wes lurching along the trail ahead of me   struggling with all his gear. He shuffled along behind his brothers careful not   to drop behind. Not a syllable of complaint escaped his lips.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -1.5pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>We climbed   to the crest of a hill up earthen stairs built into the hillside. Finally, I   asked Wes if I could carry the pack for a while. He smiled quietly and handed   the thing to me.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -1.5pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>The guys   hiked quietly trying to "leave no trace." The air was sweet with the scent of   autumn. Goldenrod nodded yellow along the trial. We crossed a footbridge over a   stream that ran among small boulders. At one point, we came to the edge of the   wood overlooking acres of corn ripening in an undulating field.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -1.5pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>I kept   Wes's pack and finally asked him, "What's in the pack, Wes?" "A calculator," he   said. I thought I misunderstood him. I thought maybe trail mix, some apples, or   maybe even some jerky would be good things to put in the pack. Maybe he packed a   field guide, field glasses, or the writings of Thoreau. Any of these would have   made sense, but Wes said, "A calculator."</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -1.5pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"What else   did you put in here, Wes?"</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -1.5pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"That's   all."</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -1.5pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"It's   kinda heavy, Buddy. Did you put some books in here, too?" "No, just the   calculator."</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -1.5pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>He   insisted the only thing the pack contained was a calculator. Then it hit me what   he meant by a calculator. He was talking about the huge desktop adding machine   that had been underfoot at home for the last few weeks! It was complete with a   power cord and a roll of paper. I was trekking the wide outdoors with an adding   machine in my backpack.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -1.5pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"Why did   you put an adding machine in your pack?"</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -1.5pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"I just   wanted something in my pack," he said.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -1.5pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Kids are   fun and full of surprises. I chuckle within every time I think of it and I am   reminded what a priceless thing it is to have a little boy to hike   with.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -1.5pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>It's   better to live than waste your precious life watching other people pretend to   live on television.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -1.5pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>It's good   to be alive, and there are people out there who want your love. Get out and do   something with the family. Spend time with the people who love you while you   still can. Visit, ride bikes, stroll the beach, walk the dog, get some pictures,   go out for coffee and pie, or go to church.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -1.5pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>If you   can't think of anything better to do, throw an adding machine in a backpack and   hit the trails.</FONT></P></DIV></DIV></div>
