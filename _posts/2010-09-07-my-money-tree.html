  <div><DIV>  <DIV class=sanjineiwen>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>For years I   wanted a flower garden. I'd spend hours thinking of different things I could   plant that would look nice together.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>But then we   had Matthew. And Marvin. And the twins, Alisa and Alan. And then Helen. Five   children. I was too busy raising them to grow a garden.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Money was   tight, as well as time. Often when my children were little, one of them would   want something that cost too much, and I'd have to say, "Do you see a money tree   outside? Money doesn't grow on trees, you know."</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Finally, all   five got through high school and college and were off on their own. I started   thinking again about having a garden.</FONT></P>  <P align=center><FONT face=Arial></FONT>  <CENTER><FONT face=Arial></FONT></CENTER>  <P><FONT face=Arial></FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>I wasn't   sure, though. I mean, gardens do cost money, and after all these years I was   used to living on a pretty lean, no-frills budget.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Then, one   spring morning, on Mother's Day, I was working in my kitchen. Suddenly, I   realized that cars were tooting their horns as they drove by. I looked out the   window and there was a new tree, planted right in my yard. I thought it must be   a weeping willow, because I saw things blowing around on all its branches. Then   I put my glasses on - and I couldn't believe what I saw.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>There was a   money tree in my yard!</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>I went   outside to look. It was true! There were dollar bills, one hundred of them,   taped all over that tree. Think of all the garden flowers I could buy with one   hundred dollars! There was also a note attached: "IOU eight hours of digging   time. Love, Marvin."</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Marvin kept   his promise, too. He dug up a nice ten-by-fifteen foot bed for me. And my other   children bought me tools, ornaments, a trellis, a sunflower stepping stone and   gardening books.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>That was   three years ago. My garden's now very pretty, just like I wanted. When I go out   and weed or tend my flowers, I don't seem to miss my children as much as I once   did. It feels like they're right there with me.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>I live up in   Michigan's Upper Peninsula, where winters are long and cold, and summers are way   too short. But every year now, when winter sets in, I look out my window and   think of the flowers I'll see next spring in my little garden. I think about   what my children did for me, and I get tears in my eyes - every time.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>I'm still not   sure that money grows on trees. But I know love   does!</FONT></P></DIV></DIV></div>
