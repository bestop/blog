  <div><DIV>  <DIV class=sanjineiwen>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Abraham   Joshua Heschel was one of the leading American Rabbis, theologians, and social   activists of the 20th century. He said something that I'll never forget and that   has stayed with me since the moment I heard it. In his book <EM>God in Search of   Man</EM>, he wrote, "Life is routine and routine is resistance to   wonder."</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>There's a   true story of a man I have worked with who has spent his entire life believing   that his ears were not symmetrical and therefore sunglasses always looked   crooked on his face. He came to accept this over time, until he came in touch   with mindfulness practice.</FONT></P>  <P align=right><FONT face=Arial><IMG   style="BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 0px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 0px solid; BORDER-TOP: #000000 0px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 0px solid"   id=1764532 title="" border=0   alt="打破常规 开始新生活 Renew your life!Change Up the Routine" align=right   src="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/language_tips/book/attachement/jpg/site1/20090824/0013729e41a90bfc814f37.jpg"   width=402 height=251 md5="" sourcedescription="编辑提供的本地文件"   sourcename="本地文件"></FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>One day as   he was standing in front of the mirror in the bathroom he chose to take a moment   to come down from his busy mind, become present, and really look at himself.   What he noticed was astonishing.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>He   suddenly realized that he had not been standing straight and that one shoulder   was slightly lower than the other. In that moment, he chose to stand up straight   and low and behold his eyeglasses were no longer crooked on his face. All this   time he thought his face was lopsided in some way when in effect, it was his   posture.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>This story   is just a metaphor for the rest of us in our lives. Over time, what do we just   get used to and learn to accept that keeps us limited in how we see things? What   in our lives has become routine to a point that we have lost our sense of wonder   in this world?</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>When   dealing with a myriad of mental health conditions (e.g., stress, anxiety,   depression, or addiction), we get stuck in routine ways of reacting to things. A   challenge may arise and the automatic reaction is "who cares, I'll never succeed   anyway." As we become accustomed to this, it can be likened to unknowingly   walking around with crooked posture. Once we become aware of it, we can begin   the process of straightening ourselves out.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>It's a   worthy question to explore: What do you notice in your life that's   routine?</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Do you   watch TV every night? Do you take the same route to work every day? If you are   in a relationship, do you sleep on the same side of the bed night after night or   does only one of you cook the meals or clean? Do you often shoot down new ideas?   Do you react to stress or pain with routine avoidance? Is this routine taking   away the wonder in everyday life?"</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>To do:   Pick one thing from your "routine list" and choose to begin becoming aware of it   and switching it up.</FONT></P></DIV></DIV></div>
