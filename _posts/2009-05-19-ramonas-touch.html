description:   手术后没多久，我去医院复查。我躺到检验台上，拉蒙娜用手抚摸着伤疤。我开始轻轻地啜泣。她用关心的眼神看着我，问道，"你还没有碰过它，对吗？""嗯。"我答道。于是她把金褐色的手掌轻轻地放在我苍白的胸口上，温柔地说道，"这是你身体的一部分，这就是你。摸一摸它吧，没关系的。"她就那样替我抚摸着正在愈合的伤口。而在那下面，

It was just   after my first chemotherapy treatment.</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px; TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt">My scar was still very   tender. My arm was numb underneath. This whole set of unique and weird   sensations was like having a new roommate to share the two-bedroom apartment   formerly known as my breasts - now lovingly known as "the breast and the   chest."</P>  <P align=right><IMG id=1323551 title=""   style="BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 0px solid; BORDER-TOP: #000000 0px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 0px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 0px solid"   height=273 alt="Ramona's touch 天使的爱抚"   src="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/language_tips/book/attachement/jpg/site1/20090507/0013729e41a90b6cc08b16.jpg"   width=403 align=right border=0 zmxid="zoomXimageId6" md5=""   sourcedescription="编辑提供的本地文件" sourcename="本地文件"></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px; TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt">As usual, I was taken to an   examination room to have my blood drawn, again - a terrifying process for me,   since I'm so frightened of needles.</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px; TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt">I lay down on the examining   table. I'd worn a big plaid flannel shirt and a camisole underneath. It was a   carefully thought out costume that I hoped others would regard as a casual   wardrobe choice. The plaid camouflaged my new chest, the camisole protected it   and the buttons on the shirt made for easy medical access.</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px; TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt">Ramona entered the room.   Her warm sparkling smile was familiar, and stood out in contrast to my fears.   I'd first seen her in the office a few weeks earlier. She wasn't my nurse on   that day, but I remember her because she was laughing. She laughed in deep,   round and rich tones. I remember wondering what could be so funny behind that   medical door. What could she possibly find to laugh about at a time like this?   So I decided she wasn't serious enough about the whole thing and that I would   try to find a nurse who was. But I was wrong.</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px; TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt">This day was different.   Ramona had taken my blood before. She knew about my fear of needles, and she   kindly hid the paraphernalia under a magazine with a bright blue picture of a   kitchen being remodeled. As we opened the blouse and dropped the camisole, the   catheter on my breast was exposed and the fresh scar on my chest could be   seen.</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px; TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt">She said, "How is your scar   healing?"</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px; TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt">I said, "I think pretty   well. I wash around it gently each day." The memory of the shower water hitting   my numb chest flashed across my face.</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px; TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt">She gently reached over and   ran her hand across the scar, examining the smoothness of the healing skin and   looking for any irregularities. I began to cry gently and quietly. She brought   her warm eyes to mine and said, "You haven't touched it yet, have you?" And I   said, "No."</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px; TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt">So this wonderful, warm   woman laid the palm of her golden brown hand on my pale chest and she gently   held it there. For a long time. I continued to cry quietly. In soft tones she   said, "This is part of your body. This is you. It's okay to touch it." But I   couldn't. So she touched it for me. The scar. The healing wound. And beneath it,   she touched my heart.Then Ramona said, "I'll hold your hand while you touch it."   So she placed her hand next to mine, and we both were quiet. That was the gift   that Ramona gave me.</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px; TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt">That night as I lay down to   sleep, I gently placed my hand on my chest and I left it there until I dozed   off. I knew I wasn't alone. We were all in bed together, metaphorically   speaking, my breast, my chest, Ramona's gift and   me.</P></FONT></DIV></div>
