It sounded like an intense but satisfying life.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p style="margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:18.0pt;background:white;vertical-align:baseline;font-stretch: inherit;box-sizing: border-box;orphans: auto;text-align:start;widows: auto;-webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;word-spacing:0px">  <span style="font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:#4D4F51">Then I asked him again, &#8220;How are you<span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></span><em><span style="font-family:inherit;color:#4D4F51;border:none windowtext 1.0pt;padding:0in">really</span></em><span style="font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:#4D4F51">?&#8221;   And the moment I did, he became emotional and the reality of his life just flooded out of him: his stress, his frustration of trying to juggle it all, his sense that he had no time to really think, or play with his children or enjoy any of it. The (cute) summary   is this: his schedule was always filled but his life wasn&#8217;t fulfilled. What is less cute is the idea that he, and many of us, have been sold a bill of goods.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p style="margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:18.0pt;background:white;vertical-align:baseline;font-stretch: inherit;box-sizing: border-box;orphans: auto;text-align:start;widows: auto;-webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;word-spacing:0px">  <span style="font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:#4D4F51">We&#8217;ve been sold on a heroic ideal of the uber-man and super-women who kill themselves saying yes to everyone, sleeping four hours a night and straining to fit everything in.

It suffocates our ability to think and create. It holds otherwise hard working, capable people back from our highest contribution. Below are a few of the myths   of success that hold us back from becoming very successful.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p style="margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:18.0pt;background:white;vertical-align:baseline;font-stretch: inherit;box-sizing: border-box;orphans: auto;text-align:start;widows: auto;-webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;word-spacing:0px">  <strong><span style="font-family:inherit;color:#4D4F51;border:none windowtext 1.0pt;padding:0in">Myth 1: Successful people say, &quot;If I can fit it in, I should fit it in.&quot;</span></strong><span style="font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:#4D4F51"><o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p style="margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:18.0pt;background:white;vertical-align:baseline;font-stretch: inherit;box-sizing: border-box;orphans: auto;text-align:start;widows: auto;-webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;word-spacing:0px">  <em><span style="font-family:inherit;color:#4D4F51;border:none windowtext 1.0pt;padding:0in">Truth: Very successful people are absurdly selective.</span></em><span style="font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:#4D4F51"><o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p style="mso-margin-top-alt:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:22.5pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:18.0pt;background:white;vertical-align:baseline;font-stretch: inherit;box-sizing: border-box;orphans: auto;text-align:start;widows: auto;-webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;word-spacing:0px">  <span style="font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:#4D4F51">As Warren Buffet is credited with having said, &#8220;The difference between successful people and very successful people is that very successful people say no to almost everything.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p style="mso-margin-top-alt:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:22.5pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:18.0pt;background:white;vertical-align:baseline;font-stretch: inherit;box-sizing: border-box;orphans: auto;text-align:start;widows: auto;-webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;word-spacing:0px">  <span style="font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:#4D4F51">As I wrote in a piece for Harvard Business Review, this means, &quot;Not just haphazardly saying no, but purposefully, deliberately, and strategically eliminating the nonessentials. Not just once a   year as part of a planning meeting, but constantly reducing, focusing and simplifying. Not just getting rid of the obvious time wasters, but being willing to cut out really terrific opportunities as well. Few appear to have the courage to live this principle,   which may be why it differentiates successful people and organizations from the very successful ones.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p style="margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:18.0pt;background:white;vertical-align:baseline;font-stretch: inherit;box-sizing: border-box;orphans: auto;text-align:start;widows: auto;-webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;word-spacing:0px">  <strong><span style="font-family:inherit;color:#4D4F51;border:none windowtext 1.0pt;padding:0in">Myth 2: Successful people sleep four hours a night.</span></strong><span style="font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:#4D4F51"><o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p style="margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:18.0pt;background:white;vertical-align:baseline;font-stretch: inherit;box-sizing: border-box;orphans: auto;text-align:start;widows: auto;-webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;word-spacing:0px">  <em><span style="font-family:inherit;color:#4D4F51;border:none windowtext 1.0pt;padding:0in">Truth: Very successful people rest well so they can be at peak performance.</span></em><span style="font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:#4D4F51"><o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p style="mso-margin-top-alt:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:22.5pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:18.0pt;background:white;vertical-align:baseline;font-stretch: inherit;box-sizing: border-box;orphans: auto;text-align:start;widows: auto;-webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;word-spacing:0px">  <span style="font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:#4D4F51">In K. Anders Ericsson's famous study of violinists, popularized by Malcolm Gladwell as the &quot;10,000 hour rule,&quot; Anders found that the best violinists spent more time practicing than the merely   good students. What is less well known is that the second most important factor differentiating the best violinists from the good ones was actually sleep. The best violinists averaged 8.6 hours of sleep in every 24 hour period.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p style="margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:18.0pt;background:white;vertical-align:baseline;font-stretch: inherit;box-sizing: border-box;orphans: auto;text-align:start;widows: auto;-webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;word-spacing:0px">  <strong><span style="font-family:inherit;color:#4D4F51;border:none windowtext 1.0pt;padding:0in">Myth 3: Successful people think play is a waste of time.</span></strong><span style="font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:#4D4F51"><o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p style="margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:18.0pt;background:white;vertical-align:baseline;font-stretch: inherit;box-sizing: border-box;orphans: auto;text-align:start;widows: auto;-webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;word-spacing:0px">  <em><span style="font-family:inherit;color:#4D4F51;border:none windowtext 1.0pt;padding:0in">Truth: Very successful people see play as essential for creativity.</span></em><span style="font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:#4D4F51"><o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p style="mso-margin-top-alt:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:22.5pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:18.0pt;background:white;vertical-align:baseline;font-stretch: inherit;box-sizing: border-box;orphans: auto;text-align:start;widows: auto;-webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;word-spacing:0px">  <span style="font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:#4D4F51">Just think of Sir Ken Robinson, who has made the study of creativity in schools his life's work. He has observed that instead of fueling creativity through play, schools actually kill it: &quot;We   have sold ourselves into a fast-food model of education, and it's impoverishing our spirit and our energies as much as fast food is depleting our physical bodies. Imagination is the source of every form of human achievement.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p style="margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:18.0pt;background:white;vertical-align:baseline;font-stretch: inherit;box-sizing: border-box;orphans: auto;text-align:start;widows: auto;-webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;word-spacing:0px">  <strong><span style="font-family:inherit;color:#4D4F51;border:none windowtext 1.0pt;padding:0in">Myth 4: Successful people are the first ones to jump in with an answer.</span></strong><span style="font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:#4D4F51"><o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p style="margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:18.0pt;background:white;vertical-align:baseline;font-stretch: inherit;box-sizing: border-box;orphans: auto;text-align:start;widows: auto;-webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;word-spacing:0px">  <em><span style="font-family:inherit;color:#4D4F51;border:none windowtext 1.0pt;padding:0in">Truth: Very successful people are powerful listeners.</span></em><span style="font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:#4D4F51"><o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p style="mso-margin-top-alt:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:22.5pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:18.0pt;background:white;vertical-align:baseline;font-stretch: inherit;box-sizing: border-box;orphans: auto;text-align:start;widows: auto;-webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;word-spacing:0px">  <span style="font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:#4D4F51">As the saying goes, the people who talk the most don't always have the most to say.

His team won 418 games with only 10 losses in over 36 years. One of the key questions   he challenged his players to ask was &#8220;What&#8217;s important now?&quot; He didn't want his players getting distracted with what the other team was doing. He wanted them to play their own game.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p style="mso-margin-top-alt:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:22.5pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:18.0pt;background:white;vertical-align:baseline;font-stretch: inherit;box-sizing: border-box;orphans: auto;text-align:start;widows: auto;-webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;word-spacing:0px">  <span style="font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:#4D4F51">Last week I took a tour of the Kennedy Presidential Library in Boston, Massachusetts. One of the quotes there grabbed my attention. John F. Kennedy said, &quot;The great enemy of the truth is very   often not the lie, deliberate, contrived and dishonest, but the myth, persistent, persuasive and unrealistic.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p style="mso-margin-top-alt:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:22.5pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:18.0pt;background:white;vertical-align:baseline;font-stretch: inherit;box-sizing: border-box;orphans: auto;text-align:start;widows: auto;-webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;word-spacing:0px">  <span style="font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:#4D4F51">The myth here is celebrated in modern culture: it&#8217;s someone who is capable, driven and wants to win and be popular. They have been rewarded for their willingness to take it all on, fit it all   in and just make it happen. They believe doing more is better than doing less. I call this type of person a Nonessentialist.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p style="mso-margin-top-alt:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:22.5pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:18.0pt;background:white;vertical-align:baseline;font-stretch: inherit;box-sizing: border-box;orphans: auto;text-align:start;widows: auto;-webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;word-spacing:0px">  <span style="font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:#4D4F51">Still, there is a new hero in our story. She asks, &#8220;What is essential?&#8221; and is willing to eliminate everything else. He says no to the less important activities so they can give themselves fully   to the few things that really matter. It is a path that takes courage. It may require making the tradeoff between short-term popularity and long-term respect. It leads to a greater sense of control and even joy. But as an added benefit it also seems to be   the thing that distinguishes the successful from the very successful.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  </div>  </div>
