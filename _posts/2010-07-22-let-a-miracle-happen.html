  <div><DIV>  <DIV class=sanjineiwen>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"There's a   new student waiting in your room," my principal announced, hurrying past me on   the stairs. "Name's Mary. I need to talk to you about her. Stop in the office   later."</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>I nodded   and glanced down at the packs of pink, red and white paper, and the jars of   paste and boxes of scissors I held in my arms. "Fine," I said. "I've just come   from the supply room. We're making valentine envelopes this morning. It'll be a   good way for her to get acquainted."</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>This was my   third year of teaching fourth-graders, but I was already aware how much they   loved Valentine's Day (now just a week away), and making these bright containers   to tape to the fronts of their desks was a favorite activity. Mary would surely   be caught up in the excitement and be chatting cheerfully with new friends   before the project was finished. Humming to myself, I continued up the   stairs.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>I didn't   see her at first. She was sitting in the back of the room with her hands folded   in her lap. Her head was down and long, light-brown hair fell forward, caressing   the softly shadowed cheeks.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"Welcome,   Mary," I said. "I'm so glad you'll be in our room. And this morning you can make   an envelope to hold your valentines for our party on Valentine's   Day."</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>No   response. Had she heard me?</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"Mary," I   said again, slowly and distinctly.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>She raised   her head and looked into my eyes. The smile on my face froze. A chill went   through me and I stood motionless. The eyes in that sweet, little-girl face were   strangely empty - as if the owner of a house had drawn the blinds and gone away.   Once before I had seen such eyes: They had belonged to an inmate of a mental   institution, one I'd visited as a college student. "She's found life   unendurable," the resident psychiatrist had explained, "so she's retreated from   the world." She had, he went on, killed her husband in a fit of insane   jealousy.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>But this   child - she could have been my own small, lovable niece except for those blank,   desolate eyes. Dear God, I thought, what horror has entered the life of this   innocent little girl?</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>I longed to   take her in my arms and hug the hurt away. Instead, I pulled books from the   shelf behind her and placed them in her lap. "Here are texts you'll be using,   Mary. Would you like to look at them?" Mechanically, she opened each book,   closed it and resumed her former position.</FONT></P>  <P align=right><FONT face=Arial></FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>The bell   rang then, and the children burst in on a wave of cold, snowy air. When they saw   the valentine materials on my desk, they bubbled with excitement.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>There was   little time to worry about Mary that first hour. I took attendance, settled Mary   into her new desk and introduced her. The children seemed subdued and confused   when she failed to acknowledge the introduction or even raise her   head.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Quickly, in   order to divert them, I distributed materials for the envelopes and suggested   ways to construct and decorate them. I placed materials on Mary's desk, too, and   asked Kristie, her nearest neighbor, to offer help.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>With the   children happily engrossed, I escaped to the office. "Sit down," my principal   said, "and I'll fill you in." The child, she said, had been very close to her   mother, living alone with her in a Detroit suburb. One night, several weeks ago,   someone had broken into their home and shot and killed the mother in Mary's   presence. Mary escaped, screaming, to a neighbor's. Then the child went into   shock. She hadn't cried or mentioned her mother since.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>The   principal sighed and then went on. "Authorities sent her here to live with her   only relative - a married sister. The sister enrolled Mary this morning. I'm   afraid we'll get little help from her. She's divorced, with three small children   to support. Mary is just one more responsibility."</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"But what   can I do?" I stammered. "I've never known a child like this before." I felt so   inadequate.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"Give her   love," she suggested, "lots and lots of love. She's lost so much. There's   prayer, too - and faith, faith that will make her a normal little girl again if   you just don't lose hope."</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>I returned   to my room to discover that the children were already shunning this "different"   child. Not that Mary noticed. Even kindly little Kristie looked affronted. "She   won't even try," she told me.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>I sent a   note to the principal to remove Mary from the room for a short time. I needed to   enlist the children's help before recess, before they could taunt her about   being "different."</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"Mary's   been hurt badly," I explained gently, "and she's so quiet because she's afraid   she'll be hurt again. You see, her mother just died, and there's no one else who   loves her. You must be very patient and understanding. It may be a long time   before she's ready to laugh and join in your games, but you can do a lot to help   her."</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Bless all   children. How loving they can be once they understand. On Valentine's Day,   Mary's envelope overflowed. She looked at each card without comment and replaced   it in her container. She didn't take them home, but at least she looked at   them.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>She arrived   at school insufficiently dressed for the bitterly cold weather. Her raw, chapped   hands - without mittens - cracked and bled. Although she seemed oblivious to   sore hands and the cold, I sewed buttons on her thin coat, and the children   brought caps, scarves, sweaters and mittens. Kristie, like a little mother,   helped Mary bundle up before she went outdoors, and she insisted on walking to   and from school with her.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>In spite of   our efforts, we seemed to be getting no closer to Mary as the cold, dreary March   days dragged by. Even my faith was wearing thin. My heart ached so desperately,   wanting this child to come alive, to be aware of the beauty the wonder, the fun   - and, yes - even the pain of living.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Dear God, I   prayed, please let one small miracle happen. She needs it so   desperately.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Then on a   late March day, one of the boys excitedly reported a robin in the schoolyard. We   flocked to the window to see it. "Spring's here!" the children cried. "Let's   make a flower border for the room!"</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Why not? I   thought. Anything to lift our spirits. This time the papers we selected were   beautiful pastel colors - with brown strips to weave into baskets. I showed the   children how to weave the baskets and how to fashion all the flowers we welcome   in early spring. Remembering the valentine incident, I expected nothing from   Mary; nevertheless, I placed the beautifully colored papers on her desk and   encouraged her to try. Then I left the children to do their own creating, and I   spent the next half-hour sorting scraps of paper at the back of the   room.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Suddenly,   Kristie came hurrying to me, her face aglow. "Come see Mary's basket," she   exclaimed. "It's so pretty! You'll never believe it!"</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>I caught my   breath at its beauty. The gently curled petals of hyacinths, the daffodils'   fluted cups, skillfully fashioned crocuses and violets - work one would expect   from a child much older.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"Mary," I   said. "This is beautiful. How did you ever manage?"</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>She looked   at me with the shining eyes of any normal little girl. "My mother loved   flowers," she said simply. "She had all of these growing in our   garden."</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Thank you,   God, I said silently. You've given us the miracle. I knelt and put my arms   around the child. Then the tears came, slowly at first, but soon she was sobbing   her heart out against my shoulder. The other children had tears in their eyes,   too, but theirs - like mine - were tears of joy.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>We fastened   her basket in the very center of the border at the front of the room. It   remained there until school ended in June. On the last day, Mary held it   carefully as she carried it out the door. Then she came running back, pulled a   crocus from her basket and handed it to me. "This is for you," she said, and she   gave me a hug and a Mary moved away that summer. I lost track of her, but I'll   never forget her. And I know God is caring for her.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>I've kept   the crocus in my desk ever since - just to remind me of Mary and of the enduring   power of love and faith.</FONT></P></DIV></DIV></div>
