The first grade teacher gave her   class a fun assignment―to draw a picture of something for which they were   thankful.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Most of the   class might be considered economically disadvantaged, but still many would   celebrate the holiday with turkey and other traditional goodies of the season.   These, the teacher thought, would be the subjects of most of her students' art.   And they were.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>But Douglas   made a different kind of picture. Douglas was a different kind of boy. He was   the teacher's true child of misery, frail and unhappy. As other children played   at recess, Douglas was likely to stand close by her side. One could only guess   at the pain Douglas felt behind those sad eyes.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Yes, his   picture was different. When asked to draw a picture of something for which he   was thankful, he drew a hand. Nothing else. Just an empty hand.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>His   abstract image captured the imagination of his peers. Whose hand could it be?   One child guessed it was the hand of a farmer, because farmers raise turkeys.   Another suggested a police officer, because the police protect and care for   people. Still others guessed it was the hand of God, for God feeds us. And so   the discussion went―until the teacher almost forgot the young artist   himself.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>When the   children had gone on to other assignments, she paused at Douglas' desk, bent   down, and asked him whose hand it was. The little boy looked away and murmured,   "It's yours, teacher."</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>She   recalled the times she had taken his hand and walked with him here or there, as   she had the other students. How often had she said, "Take my hand, Douglas,   we'll go outside." Or, "Let me show you how to hold your pencil." Or, "Let's do   this together." Douglas was most thankful for his teacher's hand.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Brushing   aside a tear, she went on with her work.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>The story   speaks of more than thankfulness. It says something about teachers teaching and   parents parenting and friends showing friendship, and how much it means to the   Douglases of the world. They might not always say thanks, but they'll remember   the hand that reaches out.</FONT></P><FONT face=Arial> </FONT>  <DIV><FONT face=Arial></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV></div>
