  <div><DIV class=sanjineiwen>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -3pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Dear   Arizona,</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -3pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>My friend is   moving in a month―and not just to a different neighborhood, but to a whole   different country! I'm so sad, I can hardly think about anything else. I know   you can't make my friend's family stay, but I'm hoping you'll at least have some   helpful ideas. ―Already Lonely in London</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -3pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Dear Already   Lonely,</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -3pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>The first   thing I want to say is―I'm so sorry your friend is moving!</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -3pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>The second   thing I want to say is-are you from London, as in London, England? That is so   exciting! Have you ever seen the Queen? Is it true that people there drive on   the left side of the road? How big is Big Ben, really?</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -3pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>OK,I guess I   should stop asking questions and get back to your letter-which reminds me of how   beyond and I was when my friend Elizabeth had to move.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -3pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>I met   Elizabeth in my very first karate class. I was the only new kid in the class.   Everyone else knew a lot of the moves already and had yellow or orange   belts.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -3pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>I had a   total beginner's white belt and felt unbearably nervous the whole way through   the class. I tried my hardest to follow along, but everything was way harder   than I thought it would be.</FONT></P>  <P align=right><FONT face=Arial><IMG   style="BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 0px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 0px solid; BORDER-TOP: #000000 0px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 0px solid"   id=1879224 title="" border=0 alt="Friends forever 永远的朋友" align=right   src="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/language_tips/book/attachement/jpg/site1/20091015/0013729e41a90c40c8b204.jpg"   width=322 height=266 md5="" sourcedescription="编辑提供的本地文件"   sourcename="本地文件"></FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -3pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Afterward,   as I was putting on my shoes, I was thinking, There is no way I am ever coming   back to karate!</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -3pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>And that's   when I met Elizabeth.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -3pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"You did   great!" I laughed. "I was so clueless!"</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -3pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"That's how   I felt at first, too," she said. "If you want, I&nbsp;can help you   practice."</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -3pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"Really?" I   said.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -3pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"Sure. By   the way, I'm Elizabeth." She scribbled on the back of a karate schedule. "Here's   my number."</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -3pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"Wow, that's   so nice of you!" I said.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -3pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>She smiled.   "No problem."</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -3pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Anyway, to   make a long story short, I called her a few days later, and we've been amazing   friends ever since.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -3pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Now for the   sad part. Not very long ago, Elizabeth had to move. Her family still lives in   California, but if you know anything about my state, then you know it's   gigantic. And I'm not positive about the exact geographic details, but the   distance Elizabeth moved was about the same as if she had moved from London to   Paris!</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -3pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"You can't   move!" I screamed when she told me the terrible news.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -3pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"I know.   That's what I told my parents,"she said. "But they said we don' have a choice.   We'e moving in with my grandparents, and I guess it'l be way cheaper than where   we live now."</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -3pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"Wait! I   have the perfect solution,"I said. "You and your parents can move in with my   family! We can share my room, and it'l be like having a sleepover every single   night! I' sure my parents will be totally cool with it."</FONT></P>  <P align=left><FONT face=Arial><IMG   style="BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 0px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 0px solid; BORDER-TOP: #000000 0px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 0px solid"   id=1879233 title="" border=0 alt="Friends forever 永远的朋友" align=left   src="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/language_tips/book/attachement/jpg/site1/20091015/0013729e41a90c40c90f08.jpg"   width=303 height=269 md5="" sourcedescription="编辑提供的本地文件"   sourcename="本地文件"></FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -3pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"That would   be so great!" said Elizabeth, then she sighed. "I wish we could do that. But   there's no way. My parents also want to be closer to my grandparents, so I think   we're definitely going."</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -3pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>So Elizabeth   and I had to come up with a Plan B. A would have been, we were actually pretty   happy about our solution. Here's what we did.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -3pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>First, we   asked my mom to take a picture of us together and help us print it out regular   size and teeny-tiny size .</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -3pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>We put the   regular photos in special frames that we decorated <EM>Forever</EM>. I gave me   the frame she decorated.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -3pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Then, we cut   the teeny-tiny picture of us in half. I put the half with Elizabeth's face in my   locket necklace, and she put the half with my face in her locket   necklace.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -3pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>So even   though Elizabeth lives miles away and I only get to see her once in a while, our   Friends Forever picture frames and lockets really do help with the "missing-you"   part.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -3pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Besides   that, our parents let us e-mail sometimes, and we still get to talk and crack up   together on the phone now and then. Also, we love sending each other funny   letters and packages filled with goofy surprises.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -3pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>So, dear   Already Lonely, being separated from your friend doesn't have to be as bad as it   seems right now. Photos, letters, phone calls, e-mails, and great memories can   really and truly make a friend seem closer than he or she is.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -3pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>I hope these   ideas help. As they say in London, "cheers" to you and your friend! And as I   like to say…</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -3pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Ciao for   now,</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -3pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT   face=Arial>Arizona</FONT></P></DIV></div>
