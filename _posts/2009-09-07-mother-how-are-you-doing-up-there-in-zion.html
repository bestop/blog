  <div><DIV><FONT size=2><FONT size=3>By Han Tian <BR><BR>The leaves were once again   falling; autumn was once again with us. This morning I had received a phone call   from a friend inviting me to a small party at her home, which I was delighted   and happy to accept. <BR><BR>As soon as I stepped into my friend's garden, my   eyes were instantly attracted by the geraniums and the chrysanthemums which were   in full bloom. The fragrance from these flowers filled the air and reminded me   immediately of my parent's garden in the past. I felt a lump in my throat as the   sorrows went through my mind; my tears gathered and flowed down my face. The   chrysanthemums made me think of my mother who had passed away only last autumn.   I looked up to the sky because I knew she was now living in Zion, in the seventh   heaven. <BR><BR>My mind floated back in memory. My mother had been a very hard   working, industrious and thrifty woman with strong Chinese traditional virtues.   We were a family of nine people-----a large one with my parents, grandpa and   grandma and us five children, three sons, two daughters. I was the youngest   daughter born in the 1960's. <BR><BR>Those years were bad years with most   Chinese families suffering from the famine and other disasters. We as a family   were one of those who experienced those hard times. We barely existed on   father's meagre wages and mother's struggling income. Mother had a very hard   job----dragging the river for sand grain, which she sold to the boss of a   building site. Mother shared a big family burden with father trying to survive   during those bad days. <BR><BR>I still have memories of mother getting up early   in the morning before the break of dawn, tiptoeing out of the house with her   tools trying not to disturb anybody. Although I was a little girl at the time, I   understood in my mind that mother was heading for the river, which was in the   vicinity of our house. She would stand in the river and scoop up scanty amounts   of sand from the riverbed and then carry the heavy wet sand to the bank with a   basket on her back and struggle by crawling towards on all fours. Her clothes   would be dripping and drenched with sweat and the water seeping through the   basket. During winter, whenever she came back home from the river, I would find   her soaked through and trembling with the cold chill penetrating her body.   Mother would accumulate the river sand into a large heap drying in the open and   then riddle with a screen before selling to the building boss. No matter how   hard she worked, our family could barely make ends meet. <BR><BR>I would always   look forward to the day when mother would be selling the sand each month because   she would always bring us children dainty bits such as konfyts, boiled peanuts,   fried peas or broad beans from market after doing her business with the boss   man. These eating stuffs look common nowadays to boys and girls, but for me   during those bad times they were a big treat. <BR><BR>I remember sitting on the   threshold at the gate, waiting for mother with my brothers and sister. I would   rest my head on my hands, keeping my eyes on the road leading to the market.   River sand holds a special token for me with both sadness and happiness, which   has made a deep impression on me from my childhood. <BR><BR>Mother worked hard,   as did so many, during those years. She lived a spare life-style, making many   sacrifices and being rigorous with herself. She would never spend one cent if   she considered it unnecessary. I remember very clearly during the year I started   middle school, my farther brought home a fine piece of costume material because   he was concerned that mother always wore patched clothes. Mother was unhappy   with him for going to that expense and kept complaining to him about being   wasteful with the money. Many years later after her death my sister and I were   going through her belongings which she had kept in a large wooden case. I was   shocked to find that piece of costume material at the bottom of the case being   still intact. I held it in my hands and burst out crying: "Mother, my dearest   mother, I was only 13 when I started middle school and now I'm 41 years old. It   had been 28 years. Why did you always care for all us children but never   yourself?" <BR><BR>I was working at my office when my sister phoned 500   kilometres away from the hospital to tell me that mother was seriously ill. I   suddenly went dumb and dizzy and felt as if the sky had fallen in on me. We   spent some time talking about mother and her condition, when I put the receiver   down picking up my belongings and decided to head for the bus station. I only   had one desire that was to see my mother in person as soon as possible.   <BR><BR>I travelled all night and arrived at the hospital early in the morning.   My heart was pounding with fear and anxiety, and I raced to the ward where I   knew she was confined in. I rushed into the room and took a look at my sister's   face and knew it was not good. Mother just laid there with her eyes closed. It   was clear this was her last day----her breathing was heavy and it was clear that   she was being tortured by the cancer. I was now out of control my tears were   running down like a rushing river. "Mama, Mama, please don't leave us!" I   murmured to her. <BR><BR>My sister put her arms around me as I tried to arouse   mama from her coma. Her eyelids quivered slightly enough to tell me she had   heard my voice her youngest daughter. It was clear she had a deathbed wish to   see me one more time. My sister and I held each other with our heads on each   other's shoulders sobbing out of control. We both knew she was now on the road   to Zion and with all our crying and the shedding of tears nothing could stop   mama's journey. That happened one morning last winter when mother gave up her   life and peacefully went to sleep after many years of toiling never ever   complaining, and always had a smile----she would always say: "Tomorrow will be a   better day". <BR><BR>I smelt the fragrance of those flowers in my friend's   garden and then my mother's face appeared. Just like a burning candle, mother   always brightened those cold winter nights for us. We were five children she had   bred and worked so hard that all of us could graduate from universities and then   saw us grow up and flew away from the family nest to establish our own lives,   leaving the couple of decrepit swallows alone in the old nest. What hurtful to   all five of us was her passing away so early-----denying us the wish to be able   to pay back all those sacrifices she had made by allowing us to take care of her   now that we were so capable of doing. In the past, I was seldom back home to see   and accompany her, as I was busy with working. I thought I might have more   chances to stay with her someday in the future when I had holidays. However, I   now realize the chance to make up for that big loss has disappeared. It is too   late to retrieve anything. Whenever I think about it, I always condemn myself   with shame and regret! <BR><BR>It was the year when mother had taken her journey   that the chrysanthemums in our old garden, which she had planted herself, were   in such luxuriant bloom. I mixed the white petals with mother's cremains and   then walked over to the mountain slope at the back of our garden then scattered   them into the breeze. I now know for sure that mother will hear our laughing and   talking when we are staying at home with father---she will smile and be happy   that we care. <BR><BR>It will be Mid-Autumn Festival again tomorrow (15th day of   the 8th lunar month, one of the important Chinese traditional days for family   members to reunite). It will be the first Mid-Autumn Festival after mother left.   I'm going to see my father after the party and all my brothers and sister will   be home too. However, mother is now absent forever. When I'm thinking of her, I   get depressed and sorrowful with tears in my eyes. <BR><BR>The mum flowers in   our old garden would be in full bloom again this autumn. I quietly said to her   in my mind: "Mother, can you smell the fragrance there from beyond? Do you know   how much I miss you? How are you doing up there in Zion?"   </FONT><BR></FONT></DIV></div>
