I have seen passion turn to poison. I have   grieved with patients for the love they lost or never found.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"We seemed   to love so much, but now it's gone," one woman lamented to me.&nbsp;"Why do I   feel so lonely every night even when he is right there beside me? Why can't   marriage be more than this?"</FONT></P>  <P align=right><FONT face=Arial><IMG style="WIDTH: 300px; HEIGHT: 299px"   id=3011116 title="" border=0 alt="Put time where love is 舍得为爱付出时间" align=right   src="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/language_tips/book/attachement/jpg/site1/20100720/0013729e41a90dafa44619.jpg"   md5="" sourcedescription="编辑提供的本地文件" sourcename="本地文件"></FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>It can. I   was once invited to the 60th-anniversary celebration of a remarkable couple. I   asked the husband, Peter, if he ever felt lonely and wondered where the love   between him and Lita had gone. Peter laughed and said, "If you wonder where your   love went, you forgot that you are the one who makes it. Love&nbsp;is not out   there; it's in here between Lita and me."</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>I know we   can love deeply, tenderly and lastingly. I have seen such love, and I have felt   such love myself. Here are the law I have discovered for such lasting and loving   relationships---put time where love is.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>A   fulfilling marriage begins when two people make time together their No.1   priority. If we hope to find love, we must first find time for   loving.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT   face=Arial>Unfortunately, current psychology rests on the model of the   independent ego. To make a lasting marriage we have to overcome   self-centeredness. We must go beyond what psychologist Abraham Maslow called   "self-actualization" to "us-actualization". We have to learn to put time where   love is.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Many   couples have experienced a tragic moment that taught them to value their time   together. One husband related how he sat trapped in his car after a crash. His   wife was outside, crying and banging on the window. "I thought I was going to   die before we had enough time together." He told me. "Right then I promised to   make the time to love my wife. Our time is our own now, and those hours are   sacred."</FONT></P></DIV></DIV></div>
