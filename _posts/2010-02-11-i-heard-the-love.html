  <div><DIV>  <DIV class=sanjineiwen>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>When I was growing up I do not   recall hearing the words "I love you" from my father. When your father never   says them to you when you are a child, it gets tougher and tougher for him to   say those words as he gets older. To tell the truth, I could not honestly   remember when I had last said those words to him either. I decided to set my ego   aside and make the first move. After some hesitation, in our next phone   conversation I blurted out the words, "Dad… I love you!"</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>There was a silence at the   other end and he awkwardly replied, "Well, same back at ya!"</FONT></P>  <P align=right><FONT face=Arial><IMG style="WIDTH: 150px; HEIGHT: 144px"   id=1053635 title="" border=0 alt="I "Heard" the Love" align=right   src="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/language_tips/book/attachement/jpg/site1/20081027/0013729e42d20a6fa9760d.jpg"   zmxid="zoomXimageId6" md5="" sourcedescription="编辑提供的本地文件"   sourcename="本地文件"></FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial></FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>I chuckled and said, "Dad, I   know you love me, and when you are ready, I know you will say what you want to   say."</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Fifteen minutes later my mother   called and nervously asked, "Paul, is everything okay?"</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>A few weeks later, Dad   concluded our phone conversation with the words, "Paul, I love you." I was at   work during this conversation and the tears were rolling down my cheeks as I   finally "heard" the love. As we both sat there in tears we realized that this   special moment had taken our father/son relationship to a new level.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>A short while after this   special moment, my father narrowly escaped death following heart surgery. Many   times since, I have pondered the thought, if I did not take the first step and   Dad did not survive the surgery, I would have never "heard" the   love.</FONT></P></DIV></DIV></div>
