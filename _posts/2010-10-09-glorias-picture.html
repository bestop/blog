  <div><DIV>  <DIV class=sanjineiwen>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Golden   sunlight danced in the treetops, and children's laughter filled the park. The   smell of popcorn played on the breeze, and life seemed good. It was one of the   happiest Saturday mornings I had spent with my little daughter, Gigi.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>That is,   until two strangers threw her into their car and sped away. It seemed like a bad   dream. I could barely whisper when the police questioned me. For hours we   waited, but there was no word on the whereabouts of the car. Tears would start   to come. Then nothing. I was numb with fear.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"Go home,   Ma'am," the sergeant said. "I'll have an officer drive you. We'll also want to   monitor your telephone. The kidnappers might call, and we'll want to get a   trace. Trust me, these guys can't get far." After what had just happened, it was   hard for me to trust anything.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>My friend   Gloria came over that afternoon. "I heard about Gigi on the radio," she said.   "Everyone is looking for the car. The interstates are all blocked." She took my   hand.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"Look   here," Gloria said. "I want you have this picture, and I want you to pray with   me."</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>It was a   picture of a little girl sound asleep in her bed. Standing by the bed was a   tall, blond angel. His hand was touching the girl's shoulder as he smiled down   at her.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>My nerves   were frazzled. "You know I don't believe in that kind of thing!" I snapped. "I'm   too exhausted for any <FONT color=#006699>hocus-pocus</FONT> right now, Gloria!   I want my daughter home!" I started to shake, and then I began   sobbing.</FONT></P>  <P align=center><FONT face=Arial></FONT>  <CENTER><FONT face=Arial><IMG   style="BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 0px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 0px solid; BORDER-TOP: #000000 0px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 0px solid"   id=2299691 title="" border=0 alt="Gloria's picture 天使的照片" align=center   src="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/language_tips/book/attachement/jpg/site1/20100318/0013729e41a90d0c146a09.jpg"   width=403 height=282 md5="" sourcedescription="编辑提供的本地文件"   sourcename="本地文件"></FONT></CENTER>  <P><FONT face=Arial></FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Gloria   placed the photo on our mantle and knelt down beside me. "Just pray with me,"   she said, holding my hand.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>I had no   strength left, so we prayed and waited what seemed an eternity. Together, we   waited by the phone until sundown. The phone never rang.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Suddenly,   the front door swung open. I looked up and screamed.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>There   stood Gigi. "Gigi! Thank God!" I cried, throwing my arms around her. "Where did   those men take you? How did you get home? Did the police find you?"</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"No   Mommy!" said Gigi. "I was real scared because those men said they were taking me   far away. We were going real fast on an old rock road I'd never seen before. But   then a tall man walked out in front of the car, and they ran off the road and   hit a tree.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Then the   tall man ran up and opened the car door and pulled me out. He was real nice, and   said I would be okay now, and that those men couldn't hurt me. I must have gone   to sleep, because then I woke up here in front of our house. He must have   brought me home."</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"But who …   how did he know … where to bring you?" My voice broke and trailed to a   whisper.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"I don't   know, Mommy," Gigi said. "But he was real friendly, and I wasn't scared of him   at all."</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Just then   Gigi noticed Gloria's picture on the mantle. "That's him!" She squealed,   pointing at the picture. "Mommy, the tall blond man dressed like an angel.   That's the man that pulled me out of the car!"</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>I felt   chill-bumps across my neck and arms. Gloria turned pale. "Are you sure that's   the man?" Gloria asked.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"Yeah,   that's him okay. Except he didn't have wings, and he was wearing blue jeans and   a tee shirt. But that's him exactly. I'd remember him anywhere!"</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Later that   night, the police found the injured kidnappers in their wrecked car fifty miles   from our home. When questioned, the driver remembered swerving to avoid hitting   a tall blond man. The backseat door that Gigi sat by had been completely torn   off its hinges.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Twenty   years have gone by. We have never heard from anyone claiming to have rescued   Gigi. There have been no logical explanations for Gigi's miraculous escape and   return home from a wreck so far away.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>There have   always been things that people can't explain. But, from that day forward, I've   never doubted that many of those things are divine miracles. I believe that all   experiences, positive and negative, are given to us for our strengthening and   learning.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Gigi now   takes her little girl to the park on Saturdays. They enjoy the sunlight as it   dances in the treetops, the smell of popcorn, and the laughter of children. She   keeps Gloria's picture on her mantle, and she remembers her angelic friend. And,   like my daughter, I have a faith that has carried me through many trials since   that day many years ago.</FONT></P></DIV></DIV></div>
