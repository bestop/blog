  <div><DIV>  <DIV class=sanjineiwen>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Three   passions, simple but overwhelmingly strong, have governed my life: the longing   for love, the search for knowledge, and unbearable pity for the suffering of   mankind. These passions, like great winds, have blown me hither and thither, in   a wayward course, over a great ocean of anguish, reaching to the very verge of   despair.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>I have sought   love, first, because it brings ecstasy - ecstasy so great that I would often   have sacrificed all the rest of life for a few hours of this joy. I have sought   it, next, because it relieves loneliness--that terrible loneliness in which one   shivering consciousness looks over the rim of the world into the cold   unfathomable lifeless abyss. I have sought it finally, because in the union of   love I have seen, in a mystic miniature, the prefiguring vision of the heaven   that saints and poets have imagined. This is what I sought, and though it might   seem too good for human life, this is what--at last--I have found.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>With equal   passion I have sought knowledge. I have wished to understand the hearts of men.   I have wished to know why the stars shine. And I have tried to apprehend the   Pythagorean power by which number holds sway above the flux. A little of this,   but not much, I have achieved.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Love and   knowledge, so far as they were possible, led upward toward the heavens. But   always pity brought me back to earth. Echoes of cries of pain reverberate in my   heart. Children in famine, victims tortured by oppressors, helpless old people a   burden to their sons, and the whole world of loneliness, poverty, and pain make   a mockery of what human life should be. I long to alleviate this evil, but I   cannot, and I too suffer.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>This has been   my life. I have found it worth living, and would gladly live it again if the   chance were offered me.</FONT></P></DIV></DIV></div>
