  <div><DIV><FONT size=2>If you have ever been discouraged because of failure, please   read on.</FONT></DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV><FONT size=2>For often, achieving what you set out to do is not the   important thing. Let me explain.</FONT></DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV><FONT size=2>Two brothers decided to dig a deep hole behind their house. As   they were working, a couple of older boys stopped by to watch.</FONT></DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV><FONT size=2>"What are you doing?" asked one of the visitors.</FONT></DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV><FONT size=2>"We plan to dig a hole all the way through the earth!" one of   the brothers volunteered excitedly.</FONT></DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV><FONT size=2>The older boys began to laugh, telling the younger ones that   digging a hole all the way through the earth was impossible.</FONT></DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV><FONT size=2>After a long silence, one of the diggers picked up a jar full   of spiders, worms and a wide assortment of insects. He removed the lid and   showed the wonderful contents to the scoffing visitors.</FONT></DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV><FONT size=2>Then he said quietly and confidently, "Even if we don't dig   all the way through the earth, look what we found along the way!"</FONT></DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV><FONT size=2>Their goal was far too ambitious, but it did cause them to   dig. And that is what a goal is for-to cause us to move in the direction we have   chosen; in other words, to set us to digging!</FONT></DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV><FONT size=2>But not every goal will be fully achieved. Not every job will   end successfully. Not every relationship will endure. Not every hope will come   to pass. Not every love will last. Not every endeavor will be completed. Not   every dream will be realized.</FONT></DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV><FONT size=2>But when you fall short of your aim, perhaps you can say,   "Yes, but look at what I found along the way! Look at the wonderful things which   have come into my life because I tried to do something!"</FONT></DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV><FONT size=2>It is in the digging that life is lived. And I believe it is   joy in the journey, in the end, that truly matters.</FONT></DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV><FONT size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV></div>
