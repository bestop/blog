There were pieces of me all over the tidy, tan tiles. He kept talking,   telling me why he was leaving, explaining it was for the best, I could do   better, it was his fault and not mine. I had heard it before many times and yet   somehow was still not immune; perhaps one did not become immune to such   felony.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -1.5pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>He left   and I tried to get on with my life. I filled the kettle and put it on to boil, I   took out my old red mug and filled it with coffee watching as each coffee   granule slipped in to the bone china. That was what my life had been like,   endless omissions of coffee granules, somehow never managing to make that cup of   coffee.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -1.5pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Somehow   when the kettle piped its finishing warning I pretended not to hear it. That's   what Mike's leaving had been like, sudden and with an awful finality. I would   rather just wallow in uncertainty than have things finished. I laughed at   myself. Imagine getting all philosophical and sentimental about a mug of coffee.   I must be getting old.<BR><BR>And yet it was a young woman who stared back at me   from the mirror. A young woman full of promise and hope, a young woman with   bright eyes and full lips just waiting to take on the world. I never loved Mike   anyway. Besides there are more important things. More important than love, I   insist to myself firmly. The lid goes back on the coffee just like closure on   the whole Mike experience.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -1.5pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>He doesn't   haunt my dreams as I feared that night. Instead I am flying far across fields   and woods, looking down on those below me. Suddenly I fall to the ground and it   is only when I wake up that I realize I was shot by a hunter, brought down by   the burden of not the bullet but the soul of the man who shot it. I realize   later, with some degree of understanding, that Mike was the hunter holding me   down and I am the bird that longs to fly. The next night my dream is similar to   the previous nights, but without the hunter. I fly free until I meet another   bird who flies with me in perfect harmony. I realize with some relief that there   is a bird out there for me, there is another person, not necessarily a lover   perhaps just a friend, but there is someone out there who is my soul mate. I   think about being a broken vase again and realize that I have glued myself back   together, what Mike has is merely a little part of my time in earth, a little   understanding of my physical being. He has only, a little piece of   me.</FONT></P></DIV></div>
