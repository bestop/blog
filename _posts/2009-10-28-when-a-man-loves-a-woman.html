Things like whom to trust,<br />how to love, how to live a good life.<br /><br />Not long ago John lost his wife,<br />Janet, to cancer. God knows she was a fighter, but in the end the disease won<br />their eight-year battle.<br /><br />One day John pulled a folded paper from his<br />wallet. He’d found it, he told me, while going through drawers in his house. It<br />was a love note, in Janet’s handwriting. It looked a little like a schoolgirl’s<br />daydream note about the boy across the way. All that was missing was a<br />hand-drawn heart and the names John and Janet. Except this note was written by<br />the mother of seven children, a woman who had begun the battle for her life, and<br />very probably was within months of the end.<br /><br />It was also a wonderful<br />prescription for holding a marriage together. This is how Janet McHugh’s note<br />about her husband begins:” Loved. Cared. Worried. ”<br /><br />As quick with a joke<br />an John is, apparently he didn’t joke with his wife about cancer. He’d come<br />home, and she’d be in one of the moods cancer patients get lost in, and he’d<br />have her in the car faster than you can say DiNardo’s, her favorite restaurant.<br />“Get in the car,” he’d say,” I’m taking you out to dinner.”<br /><br />He worried,<br />and she knew it. You don’t hide things from someone who knows<br />better.<br /><br />“Helped me when I was sick.” is next. Maybe Janet wrote her list<br />when the cancer was in one of those horrible and wonderful remission periods,<br />when all is as it was—almost—before the disease, so what harm is there in hoping<br />that it’s behind you, maybe for good?<br /><br />“Forgave me for a lot of<br />things.”<br /><br />“Stood by me.”<br /><br />And then, good service to those of us who<br />think giving constructive criticism is our religious calling: “Always<br />complimentary.”<br /><br />“Provide everything I ever needed.” Janet McHugh next<br />wrote.<br /><br />Then she’d turned the man she had lived with and been in love with<br />for the majority of her life. She’d written:” Always there when I needed<br />you.”<br /><br />The last thing she wrote sums up all the others. I can picture her<br />adding it thoughtfully to her list. ”Good friend.”<br /><br />I stand beside John<br />now, unable even to pretend that I know what it feels like to lose someone so<br />close. I need to hear what he has to say, much more than he needs to<br />talk.<br /><br />“John,” I ask,” how do you stick by someone through 38 years of<br />marriage. “let done the sickness too? How do I know I’d have what it takes to<br />stand by my wife if she got sick?”<br /><br />“you will,” he says. ”If you love her<br />enough, you will,” he says. ”If you lo</div></span></div>
