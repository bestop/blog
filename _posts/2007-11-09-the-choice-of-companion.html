  <div><DIV>The Choice of Companion<BR>　　<BR>　　Anonymous<BR>　　<BR>　　A good companion is  better than a fortune, for a fortune cannot purchase those elements of character  which make companionship a blessing. The best companion is one who is wiser and  better than ourselves, for we are inspired by his wisdom and virtue to nobler  deeds. Greater wisdom and goodness than we possess lifts us higher mentally and  morally.<BR>　　 <BR>　　"A man is known by the companion he keeps." It is always  true. Companionship of a high order is powerful to develop character. Character  makes character in the associations of life faster than anything else. Purity  begets purity, like begets like; and this fact makes the choice of companion in  early life more important even than that of teachers and guardians<BR>　　<BR>　　It  is true that we cannot always choose all of our companions, some are thrust upon  us by business or the social relations of life, we do not choose them, we do not  enjoy them; and yet, we have to associate with them more or less. The experience  is not altogether without compensation, if there be principle enough in us to  bear the strain. Still, in the main, choice of companions can be made, and must  be made. It is not best or necessary for a young person to associate with "Tom,  Dick, and Harry" without forethought or purpose. Some fixed rules about the  company he or she keeps must be observed. The subject should be uttermost in the  thoughts, and canvassed often <BR>　　<BR>　　Companionship is education, good or  not; it develops manhood or womanhood, high or low; it lifts soul upward or  drags it downward; it minister to virtue or vice. There is no half way work  about its influence. If it ennobles, it does grandly, if it demoralizes, it  doest it devilishly. It saves or destroys lustily. Nothing in the world is surer  than this. Sow virtue, and the harvest will be virtue, Sow vice, and the harvest  will be vice. Good companionships help us to sow virtue; evil companionships  help us to sow  vice.<BR>　　<BR>　　�����������<BR>　　<BR>　　择友<BR>　　<BR>　　佚名<BR>　　<BR>　　一个好友胜过一笔财富。人性中有一些品质会让友谊变成一种幸福的事，而金钱买不到这些品质。最好的朋友是那些比我们更睿智和更出色的人，他们的智慧和美德会激发我们去做更高尚的事情。他们有着比我们更多的智慧和更高尚的情操，可以在精神上和道德上将我们带入一个新的境界。<BR>　　<BR>　　  "观其友而知其人"，这句话总是对的。高层次的交往会有力地塑造一个人的性情。在交往中，品性对品性的影响胜过其它任何因素。纯洁的品格会培养纯洁的品格，爱好会引发相同的爱好。这些表明，在年少时，选择朋友甚至比选择老师和监护人还要重要。<BR>　　<BR>　　不可否认，有些朋友总是我们不能选择的。有些是工作和社会关系强加于我们的。我们没有选择他们，也不喜欢他们，可是我们不得不或多或少地与他们交往。不过，只要我们心中有足够的原则来承担压力，与他们交往也并非毫无益处。在大多数情况下，我们还是可以选择朋友的，而且，必须选择。一个年轻人毫无前瞻性，也无目的性地随意与张三李四交往，是不好的，也是没必要的。他必须遵守一些确定的交友原则，应当把它们摆在心中最高的位置，并经常加以审视。<BR>　　<BR>　　无论是有益的还是有害的友谊，都是一种教导。它可以培育或是高贵，或是卑微的品格；它可以使灵魂升华，也可以使之堕落；它可以滋生美德，也可以催生邪恶；它的影响没有折中之道：如果它让人高尚，就会用一种无比高贵的方式，如果让人堕落，也会用一种无比邪恶的方式。它可以有力地拯救一个人，也可以轻易地毁掉一个人。播种美德，就会收获美德；播种邪恶，就会收获邪恶，这是非常确定的，而有益的友谊帮我们播种美德，有害的友谊则支使我们撒下邪恶的种子。<BR></DIV></div>
