  <div><DIV>  <DIV class=sanjineiwen>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 1.5pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><EM><FONT face=Arial>"There   is nothing either good or bad,but thinking makes it so."―William Shakespeare,   "Hamlet"</FONT></EM></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 1.5pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>One of the   greatest sources of unhappiness, in my experience, is the difficulty we have in   accepting things as they are.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 1.5pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Without   judgment, without wishing for otherwise.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 1.5pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>When we see   something we don't like, we wish it could be different ― we cry out for   something better. That may be human nature, or perhaps it's something that's   ingrained in our culture.</FONT></P>  <P align=right><FONT face=Arial><IMG   style="BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 0px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 0px solid; BORDER-TOP: #000000 0px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 0px solid"   id=1754374 title="" border=0 alt="接受这世界 你会快乐" align=right   src="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/language_tips/book/attachement/jpg/site1/20090820/0013729e41a90bf70dd004.jpg"   width=258 height=316 zmxid="zoomXimageId6" md5="" sourcedescription="编辑提供的本地文件"   sourcename="本地文件"></FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 1.5pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>The root of   the unhappiness isn't necessarily that we want things to be different, however:   it's that we decided we didn't like it in the first place. We've judged it as   bad, rather than saying, "It's not bad or good, it just is."</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 1.5pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>An example:   In my recent post, <EM>A Beautiful Method to Find Peace of Mind</EM>, quite a   few commenters thought my outlook was negative, pessimistic, or fatalistic …   because I said you should expect people to mess up, expect things to go   differently than you planned, and that you should embrace that.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 1.5pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>It's too   negative to expect things to go wrong, they said. However: it's only negative if   you see it as negative. If you judge it as bad.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 1.5pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Instead,   you could accept it as the way the world works ― as the way things actually are.   And try to understand why that is, and embrace it. As it is.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 1.5pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>This can be   applied to whatever you do: whether it be how other people act at work, how   politics works and how depressing the news media can be. Accept these things as   they are, and try to understand why they're that way.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 1.5pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>It'll save   you a lot of grief, because you'll no longer say, "Oh, I wish things didn't   suck!"</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 1.5pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Does it   mean you can never change things? Not at all. But change things not because you   can't accept things as they are, but because you enjoy the process of change, of   learning and growing.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 1.5pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Can we make   this world a better place? Again, that's assuming that it's a bad place right   now. But instead, you could say the world is just what it is ― and that's   neither good nor bad. You can say that you'll continue to try to do things to   help others, to grow as a person, to make a difference in this world ― not   because you're such a bad person now, or the world sucks, but because that's the   path you choose to take, because you enjoy that path.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 1.5pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>As you   catch yourself judging, and wishing for different ― and we all do it ― try a   different approach: accept, and understand. It might lead to some interesting   results.</FONT></P></DIV></DIV></div>
