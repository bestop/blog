  <div><DIV><FONT size=2>  <DIV class=3jbiaoti><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">It has been so bitterly cold here   in Pennsylvania.</FONT></DIV>  <DIV class=3jineiwen>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">I can't remember a   winter being as cold as this, but I'm sure there were colder days.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">Even though the   daylight hours are growing longer minute by minute, it's easy to find an excuse   not to go out unless you absolutely must, but then again I often have to push   myself to accomplish things.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">People I speak to   have been in all kinds of nasty moods. They say they're "under the weather," not   feeling good about this time of year.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">As I stood outside   with my two dogs yesterday, it was so cold that my nose and face felt crisp and   my cars were stinging.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">Of course, that   doesn't matter to Ricky and Lucy. They have a routine they must go through to   find just the fight spot no matter how cold or hot it is.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">So I wait.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">But this time it was   different. As cold as it was, I suddenly was invigorated thinking about how   wonderful this extreme cold really was.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">Then the sun broke   through the clouds and memories of summer's scorching hot days flashed through   my mind. I could remember standing in the heat of the afternoon, sweat pouring   down my brow and the hot, burning sun againse my face. I reminded myself then   and there that in the cold of the winter I would wish I had this   heat.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">I was   right.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">Two extremes in my   life that most of the time I find uncomfortable, I normally dread them and gripe   about it all the way through.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">But today I was   grateful for them. Without the extremes in my life, I would never appreciate the   days when things were just right. Without the extremes life would be   boring.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">It's being pushed to   one of the extremes that makes us appreciate the middle more. Health challenges   reminds us that we need to pay more attention to how we live. Financial extremes   reminds us that when things are in excess it's time to tuck away for when the   times are lean.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">So bring on the cold   so I appreciate the heat more.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">Make me sweat on a   hot summer's day so I wish I had a handful of snow to rub my face in.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">I've come to the   conclusion that all too often I find a reason not to be happy with where I am at   that moment.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">Whether it's hot or   cold, good health or bad, in the money or out of it, I always wanted it to be   different.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">But no more. I want   to start finding a reason to be happy right where I am. Even if it's simply the   fact that I'm alive.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">I'm tired of being   "Under the Weather!"</FONT></P></DIV></FONT></DIV></div>
