  <div><DIV><FONT size=2>  <DIV class=3jbiaoti>I live in Hollywood. You may think people in such a   glamorous, fun-filled place are happier than others. If so, you have some   mistaken ideas about the nature of happiness.</DIV>  <DIV class=3jineiwen>  <P>Many intelligent people still equate happiness with fun. The truth is that   fun and happiness have little or nothing in common. Fun is what we experience   during an act. Happiness is what we experience after an act. It is a deeper,   more abiding emotion.</P>  <P>Going to an amusement park or ball game, watching a movie or television, are   fun activities that help us relax, temporarily forget our problems and maybe   even laugh. But they do not bring happiness, because their positive effects end   when the fun ends.<IMG hspace=5   src="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/language_tips/att/site1/20070301/xin_23030401093987758223.jpg"   align=right vspace=5 border=0 zmxid="zoomXimageId7" md5=""></P>  <P>I have often thought that if Hollywood stars have a role to play, it is to   teach us that happiness has nothing to do with fun. These rich, beautiful   individuals have constant access to glamorous parties, fancy cars, expensive   homes, everything that spells "happiness".</P>  <P>But in memoir after memoir, celebrities reveal the unhappiness hidden beneath   all their fun: depression, alcoholism, drug addiction, broken marriages,   troubled children, profound loneliness.</P>  <P>The way people cling to the belief that a fun-filled, pain-free life equates   happiness actually diminishes their chances of ever attaining real happiness. If   fun and pleasure are equated with happiness, then pain must be equated with   unhappiness. But, in fact, the opposite is true: More times than not, things   that lead to happiness involve some pain.</P>  <P>As a result, many people avoid the very endeavors that are the source of true   happiness. They fear the pain inevitably brought by such things as marriage,   raising children, professional achievement, religious commitment, civic or   charitable work, and self-improvement.<BR></P></DIV></FONT></DIV></div>
