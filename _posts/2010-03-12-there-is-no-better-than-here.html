  <div class="post"><h2>{{ page.title }}</h2><strong>{{ page.date | date_to_long_string }}</strong><div><DIV>  <DIV class=sanjineiwen>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Many people believe that they   will be happy once they arrive at some specific goal they set for themselves.   However, more often than not, once you arrive " there" you will still feel   dissatisfied, and move your " there" vision to yet another point in the future.   By always chasing after another "there," you are never really appreciating what   you already have right "here." It is important for human beings to keep   soberminded about the age-old drive to look beyond the place where you now   stand. On one hand, your life is enhanced by your dreams and aspirations. On the   other hand, these drives can pull you farther and farther from your enjoyment of   your life right now. By learning the lessons of gratitude and abundance, you can   bring yourself closer to fulfilling the challenge of living in the   present.</FONT></P>  <P align=left><FONT face=Arial><IMG style="WIDTH: 115px; HEIGHT: 140px"   id=1165557 title="" border=0 alt="" align=left   src="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/language_tips/book/attachement/jpg/site1/20090120/0013729e42d20adfe0a63e.jpg"   zmxid="zoomXimageId6" md5="" sourcedescription="编辑提供的本地文件" sourcename="本地文件"   is="is" no="no" better="better" than="than"></FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><STRONG><FONT   face=Arial>Gratitude</FONT></STRONG></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>To be grateful means you are   thankful for and appreciative of what you have and where you are on your path   right now. Gratitude fills your heart with the joyful feeling and allows you to   fully appreciate everything that arises on your path. As you strive to keep your   focus on the present moment, you can experience the full wonder of   "here."</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>There are many ways to   cultivate gratitude. Here are just a few suggestions you may wish to   try:</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>1. Imagine what your life would   be like if you lost all that you had. This will most surely remind you of how   much you do appreciate it.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>2. Make a list each day of all   that you are grateful for, so that you can stay conscious daily of your   blessings. Do this especially when you are feeling as though you have nothing to   feel grateful for. Or spend a few minutes before you go to sleep giving thanks   for all that you have.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>3. Spend time offering   assistance to those who are less fortunate than you, so that you may gain   perspective.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>However you choose to learn   gratitude is irrelevant. What really matters is that you create a space in your   consciousness for appreciation for all that you have right now, so that you may   live more joyously in your present moment.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT   face=Arial><STRONG>Abundance</STRONG><BR><BR>One of the most common human fears   is scarcity. Many people are afraid of not having enough of what they need or   want, and so they are always striving to get to a point when they would finally   have enough.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Alan and Linda always dreamed   of living "the good life." Both from poor working-class families, they married   young and set out to fulfill their mutual goal of becoming wealthy. They both   worked very hard for years, amassing a small fortune, so they could move from   their two-bedroom home to a palatial seven-bedroom home in the most upscale   neighborhood. They focused their energies on accumulating all the things they   believed signified abundance: membership in the local exclusive country club,   luxury cars, designer clothing, and high-class society friends. No matter how   much they accumulated, however, it never seemed to be enough. They were unable   to erase the deep fear of scarcity both had acquired in childhood. They needed   to learn the lesson of abundance. Then the stock market crashed in 1987, and   Alan and Linda lost a considerable amount of money. A bizarre but costly lawsuit   depleted another huge portion of their savings. One thing led to another, and   they found themselves in a financial disaster. Assets needed to be sold, and   eventually they lost the country club membership, the cars, and the house. It   took several years and much hard work for Alan and Linda to land on their feet,   and though they now live a life far from extravagant, they have taken stock of   their lives and feel quite blessed. Only now, as they assess what they have left   -- a solid, loving marriage, their health, a dependable income, and good friends   -- do they realize that true abundance comes not from amassing, but rather from   appreciating.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Scarcity consciousness arises   as a result of the "hole-in-the-soul syndrome." This is when we attempt to fill   the gaps in our inner lives with things from the outside world. But like puzzle   pieces, you can't fit something in where it does not naturally belong. No amount   of external objects, affection, love, or attention can ever fill an inner void.   We already have enough, so we should revel in our own interior   abundance.</FONT></P></DIV></DIV></div>
