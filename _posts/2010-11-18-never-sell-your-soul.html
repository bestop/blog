But all of you should know: as Mother's Day gifts go, this one is going to be   tough to beat in the years ahead.</FONT>  <DIV class=sanjineiwen>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>The   purpose of a commencement speaker is to dispense wisdom. But the older I get,   the more I realize that the most important wisdom I've learned in life has come   from my mother and my father. Before we go any further, let's hear it one more   time for your mothers and mother figures, fathers and father figures, family,   and friends in the audience today.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>When I   first received the invitation to speak here, I was the CEO of an $80 billion   Fortune 11 company with 145,000 employees in 178 countries around the world. I   held that job for nearly six years. It was also a company that hired its fair   share of graduates from North Carolina A&amp;T. You could always tell who they   were. For some reason, they were the ones that had stickers on their desks that   read, "Beat the Eagles."</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>But as you   may have heard, I don't have that job anymore. After the news of my departure   broke, I called the school, and asked: do you still want me to come and be your   commencement speaker?</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Chancellor   Renick put my fears to rest. He said, "Carly, if anything, you probably have   more in common with these students now than you did before." And he's right.   After all, I've been working on my resume. I've been lining up my references. I   bought a new interview suit. If there are any recruiters here, I'll be free   around 11.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>I want to   thank you for having me anyway. This is the first public appearance I've made   since I left HP. I wanted very much to be here because this school has always   been set apart by something that I've believed very deeply; something that takes   me back to the earliest memories I have in life.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>One day at   church, my mother gave me a small coaster with a saying on it. During my entire   childhood, I kept this saying in front of me on a small desk in my room. In   fact, I can still show you that coaster today. It says: "What you are is God's   gift to you. What you make of yourself is your gift to God."</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Those   words have had a huge impact on me to this day. What this school and I believe   in very deeply is that when we think about our lives, we shouldn't be limited by   other people's stereotypes or bigotry. Instead, we should be motivated by our   own sense of possibility. We should be motivated by our own sense of   accomplishment. We should be motivated by what we believe we can become. Jesse   Jackson has taught us; Ronald McNair taught us; the Greensboro Four taught us;   that the people who focus on possibilities achieve much more in life than people   who focus on limitations.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>The   question for all of you today is: how will you define what you make of   yourself?</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>To me,   what you make of yourself is actually two questions. There's the "you" that   people see on the outside. And that's how most people will judge you, because   it's all they can see what you become in life, whether you were made President   of this, or CEO of that, the visible you.</FONT></P>  <P align=right><FONT face=Arial><IMG   style="BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 0px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 0px solid; BORDER-TOP: #000000 0px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 0px solid"   id=2408189 title="" border=0 alt="Never sell your soul 不要出卖灵魂" align=right   src="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/language_tips/book/attachement/jpg/site1/20100429/0013729e41a90d436e6838.jpg"   width=323 height=285 md5="" sourcedescription="编辑提供的本地文件"   sourcename="本地文件"></FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>But then,   there's the invisible you, the "you" on the inside. That's the person that only   you and God can see. For 25 years, when people have asked me for career advice,   what I always tell them is don't give up what you have inside. Never sell your   soul. Because no one can ever pay you back.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>What I   mean by not selling your soul is don't be someone you're not, don't be less than   you are, don't give up what you believe, because whatever the consequences that   may seem scary or bad -- whatever the consequences of staying true to yourself   are -- they are much better than the consequences of selling your   soul.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>You have   been tested mightily in your life to get to this moment. And all of you know   much better than I do: from the moment you leave this campus, you will be   tested. You will be tested because you won't fit some people's pre-conceived   notions or stereotypes of what you're supposed to be, of who you're supposed to   be. People will have stereotypes of what you can or can't do, of what you will   or won't do, of what you should or shouldn't do. But they only have power over   you if you let them have power over you. They can only have control if you let   them have control, if you give up what's inside.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>I speak   from experience. I've been there. I've been there, in admittedly vastly   different ways -- and in many ways, in the fears in my heart, exactly the same   places. The truth is I've struggled to have that sense of control since the day   I left college.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>I was   afraid the day I graduated from college. I was afraid of what people would   think. Afraid I couldn't measure up. I was afraid of making the wrong choices. I   was afraid of disappointing the people who had worked so hard to send me to   college.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>I had   graduated with a degree in medieval history and philosophy. If you had a job   that required knowledge of Copernicus or 12th Century European monks, I was your   person. But that job market wasn't very strong.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>So, I was   planning to go to law school, not because it was a lifelong dream. Because I   thought it was expected of me. Because I realized that I could never be the   artist my mother was, so I would try to be the lawyer my father was. So, I went   off to law school. For the first three months, I barely slept. I had a blinding   headache every day. And I can tell you exactly which shower tile I was looking   at in my parent's bathroom on a trip home when it hit me like a lightning bolt.   This is my life. I can do what I want. I have control. I walked downstairs and   said, "I quit."</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>I will   give my parents credit in some ways. That was 1976. They could have said, "Oh   well, you can get married." Instead, they said, "We're worried that you'll never   amount to anything." It took me a while to prove them wrong. My first job was   working for a brokerage firm. I had a title. It was not "VP." It was   "receptionist." I answered phones, I typed, I filed. I did that for a year. And   then, I went and lived in Italy, teaching English to Italian businessmen and   their families. I discovered that I liked business. I liked the pragmatism of   it; the pace of it. Even though it hadn't been my goal, I became a   businessperson.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>I like big   challenges, and the career path I chose for myself at the beginning was in one   of the most male-dominated professions in America. I went to work for AT&amp;T.   It didn't take me long to realize that there were many people there who didn't   have my best interests at heart.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>I began my   career as a first level sales person within AT&amp;T's long lines department.   Now, "long lines" is what we used to call the long distance business, but I used   to refer to the management team at AT&amp;T as the "42 longs" which was their   suit size, and all those suits and faces looked the same.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>I'll never   forget the first time my boss at the time introduced me to a client. With a   straight face, he said "this is Carly Fiorina, our token bimbo." I laughed, I   did my best to dazzle the client, and then I went to the boss when the meeting   was over and said, "You will never do that to me again."</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>In those   early days, I was put in a program at the time called the Management Development   Program. It was sort of an accelerated up-or-out program, and I was thrown into   the middle of a group of all male sales managers who had been there quite a long   time, and they thought it was their job to show me a thing or two. A client was   coming to town and we had decided that we were getting together for lunch to   introduce me to this customer who was important to one of my   accounts.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Now the   day before this meeting was to occur, one of my male colleagues came to me and   said, "You know, Carly, I'm really sorry. I know we've had this planned for a   long time, but this customer has a favorite restaurant here in Washington, D.C.,   and they really want to go to that restaurant, and we need to do what the   customer wants, and so I don't think you'll be able to join   us."</FONT></P></DIV></DIV></div>
