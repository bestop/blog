  <div><DIV><FONT size=2>It was a cold night in Washington, D.C., and I was heading   back to the hotel when a man approached me. He asked if I would give him some   money so he could get something to eat. I'd read the signs: "Don't give money to   panhandlers." So I shook my head and kept walking.</FONT></DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV><FONT size=2>I wasn't prepared for a reply, but with resignation, he said,   "I really am homeless and I really am hungry! You can come with me and watch me   eat!" But I kept on walking.</FONT></DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV><FONT size=2>The incident bothered me for the rest of the week. I had money   in my pocket and it wouldn't have killed me to hand over a buck or two even if   he had been lying. On a frigid, cold night, no less, I assumed the worst of a   fellow human being.</FONT></DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV><FONT size=2>Flying back to Anchorage, I couldn't help thinking of him. I   tried to rationalize my failure to help by assuming government agencies,   churches and charities were there to feed him. Besides, you're not supposed to   give money to panhandlers.</FONT></DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV><FONT size=2>Somewhere over Seattle, I started to write my weekly garden   column for The Anchorage Daily News. Out of the blue, I came up with an idea.   Bean's Cafe, the soup kitchen in Anchorage, feeds hundreds of hungry Alaskans   every day. Why not try to get all my readers to plant one row in their gardens   dedicated to Bean's? Dedicate a row and take it down to Bean's. Clean and   simple.</FONT></DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV><FONT size=2>We didn't keep records back then, but the idea began to take   off. Folks would fax me or call when they took something in. Those who only grew   flowers donated them. Food for the spirit. And salve for my   conscience.</FONT></DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV><FONT size=2>In 1995, the Garden Writers Association of America held their   annual convention in Anchorage and after learning of Anchorage's program, Plant   a Row for Bean's became Plant a Row For The Hungry. The original idea was to   have every member of the Garden Writers Association of America write or talk   about planting a row for the hungry sometime during the month of   April.</FONT></DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV><FONT size=2>As more and more people started working with the Plant a Row   concept, new variations cropped up, if you will pardon the pun. Many companies   gave free seed to customers and displayed the logo, which also appeared in   national gardening publications.</FONT></DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV><FONT size=2>Row markers with the Plant a Row logo were distributed to   gardeners to set apart their "Row for the Hungry."</FONT></DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV><FONT size=2>Garden editor Joan Jackson, backed by The San Jose Mercury   News and California's nearly year-round growing season, raised more than 30,000   pounds of fruits and vegetables her first year, and showed GWAA how the program   could really work.</FONT></DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV><FONT size=2>Texas fruit farms donated food to their local food bank after   being inspired by Plant a Row. Today the program continues to thrive and   grow.</FONT></DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV><FONT size=2>I am stunned that millions of Americans are threatened by   hunger. If every gardener in America - and we're seventy million strong - plants   one row for the hungry, we can make quite a dent in the number of neighbors who   don't have enough to eat. Maybe then I will stop feeling guilty about abandoning   a hungry man I could have helped.</FONT></DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV><FONT size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV></div>
