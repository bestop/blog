But the Buffett-ism that's stayed with me is the one at the top of this blog   – namely, the notion of a punch card (a quaintly antiquated thing you don't run across very often these days).<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p style="margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:18.0pt;background:white;vertical-align:baseline;outline: 0px;box-sizing: border-box;orphans: auto;text-align:start;widows: auto;-webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;word-spacing:0px">  <span style="font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:#4D4F51">Buffett used his punch card analogy in an investment context. It's consistent with his belief that really profitable investment decisions are few and far between. His counsel to individual investors   has always been to "wait for the fat pitch."

For   someone graduating from high school, I think the number 20 is just about right. For someone like me, in middle age, the number of un-punched punches on the card is a lot smaller. There might be only two or three left.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p style="mso-margin-top-alt:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:22.5pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:18.0pt;background:white;vertical-align:baseline;outline: 0px;box-sizing: border-box;orphans: auto;text-align:start;widows: auto;-webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;word-spacing:0px">  <span style="font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:#4D4F51">The point is, whether it's two or twenty, the number of inflection points in our lives is a lot smaller than it often seems. The trick is having the wisdom, or the instinct, to recognize "fat   pitches" at the time they show up, which is always easier in hindsight. Then we need to make our big decisions count.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p style="mso-margin-top-alt:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:22.5pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:18.0pt;background:white;vertical-align:baseline;outline: 0px;box-sizing: border-box;orphans: auto;text-align:start;widows: auto;-webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;word-spacing:0px">  <span style="font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:#4D4F51">Getting married. Having children (or not). Making a career change. Starting or investing in a business. Those are obvious hole punches.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p style="mso-margin-top-alt:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:22.5pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:18.0pt;background:white;vertical-align:baseline;outline: 0px;box-sizing: border-box;orphans: auto;text-align:start;widows: auto;-webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;word-spacing:0px">  <span style="font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:#4D4F51">By contrast, the last two times I punched my card it had less to do with me, personally, than it did the opportunity to make a difference in the lives of others.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p style="mso-margin-top-alt:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:22.5pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:18.0pt;background:white;vertical-align:baseline;outline: 0px;box-sizing: border-box;orphans: auto;text-align:start;widows: auto;-webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;word-spacing:0px">  <span style="font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:#4D4F51">The first of these was agreeing to chair Wall Street's advocacy group – the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association – in the wake of the financial crisis. I did so because I never   wanted our clients, the investing public, to have to go through again the trauma and disruption they experienced in their financial and personal lives during that unprecedented and volatile period.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p style="mso-margin-top-alt:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:22.5pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:18.0pt;background:white;vertical-align:baseline;outline: 0px;box-sizing: border-box;orphans: auto;text-align:start;widows: auto;-webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;word-spacing:0px">  <span style="font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:#4D4F51">My second recent hole punch was deciding to help lead, in 2011 and 2012, a campaign to defeat a constitutional amendment that would have banned same-sex marriage in my home state of Minnesota.   I got a lot of advice and counsel against getting involved, as a business leader, in what became known as the "Vote No" campaign. But every bone in my body told me this was a once-in-a-lifetime chance to make a difference in the lives of tens of thousands   of LGBT residents in a state long known for its progressive brand, inclusive culture and values of respect and tolerance.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p style="mso-margin-top-alt:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:22.5pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:18.0pt;background:white;vertical-align:baseline;outline: 0px;box-sizing: border-box;orphans: auto;text-align:start;widows: auto;-webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;word-spacing:0px">  <span style="font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:#4D4F51">As it turned out, the support of the business community was critical not only in defeating the amendment, but then, six months later, legalizing same-sex marriage in Minnesota.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p style="mso-margin-top-alt:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:22.5pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:18.0pt;background:white;vertical-align:baseline;outline: 0px;box-sizing: border-box;orphans: auto;text-align:start;widows: auto;-webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;word-spacing:0px">  <span style="font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:#4D4F51">That was last year. Just this month, two gay friends who had lived together for 34 years before getting married last year at Minneapolis' City Hall thanked me, with tears in their eyes, for being   able to celebrate their first ever wedding anniversary.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p style="mso-margin-top-alt:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:22.5pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:18.0pt;background:white;vertical-align:baseline;outline: 0px;box-sizing: border-box;orphans: auto;text-align:start;widows: auto;-webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;word-spacing:0px">  <span style="font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:#4D4F51">I wish someone had told me about Buffett's punch card analogy when I was a lot younger. However, I'm glad I have the opportunity to use it now to recognize and lean into the few remaining "big   decisions" in my life. I pass it on here as a birthday gift to others – not from me, but from Warren Buffett, who, by the simple arithmetic of his own analogy, has made a big decision once in every four of his 84 years.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p style="margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:18.0pt;background:white;vertical-align:baseline;outline: 0px;box-sizing: border-box;orphans: auto;text-align:start;widows: auto;-webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;word-spacing:0px">  <em><span style="font-family:&quot;inherit&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;color:#4D4F51;border:none windowtext 1.0pt;padding:0in">John G.
