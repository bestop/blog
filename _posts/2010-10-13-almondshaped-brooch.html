  <div class="post"><h2>{{ page.title }}</h2><strong>{{ page.date | date_to_long_string }}</strong><div><DIV>  <DIV class=sanjineiwen>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>In 1945, a   12-year-old boy saw something in a shop window that set his heart racing. But   the price―five dollars―was far beyond Reuben Earle's means. Five dollars would   buy almost a week's groceries for his family.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Reuben   couldn't ask his father for the money. Everything Mark Earle made through   fishing in Bay Roberts, Newfoundland, Canada. Reuben's mother, Dora, stretched   like elastic to feed and clothe their five children.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Nevertheless,   he opened the shop's weathered door and went inside. Standing proud and straight   in his flour-sack shirt and washed-out trousers, he told the shopkeeper what he   wanted, adding, "But I don't have the money right now. Can you please hold it   for me for some time?"</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"I'll try,"   the shopkeeper smiled. " Folks around here don't usually have that kind of money   to spend on things. It should keep for a while."</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Reuben   respectfully touched his worn cap and walked out into the sunlight with the bay   rippling in a freshening wind. There was purpose in his loping stride. He would   raise the five dollars and not tell anybody.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Hearing the   sound of hammering from a side street, Reuben had an idea.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>He ran   towards the sound and stopped at a construction site. People built their own   homes in Bay Roberts, using nails purchased in Hessian sacks from a local   factory. Sometimes the sacks were discarded in the flurry of building, and   Reuben knew he could sell them back to the factory for five cents a   piece.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>That day he   found two sacks, which he took to the rambling wooden factory and sold to the   man in charge of packing nails.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>The boy's   hand tightly clutched the five-cent pieces as he ran the two kilometers   home.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Near his   house stood the ancient barn that housed the family's goats and chickens. Reuben   found a rusty soda tin and dropped his coins inside. Then he climbed into the   loft of the barn and hid the tin beneath a pile of sweet smelling   hay.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>It was dinner   time when Reuben got home. His father sat at the big kitchen table, working on a   fishing net. Dora was at the kitchen stove, ready to serve dinner as Reuben took   his place at the table.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>He looked at   his mother and smiled. Sunlight from the window gilded her shoulder-length   blonde hair. Slim and beautiful, she was the center of the home, the glue that   held it together.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Her chores   were never-ending. Sewing clothes for her family on the old Singer treadle   machine, cooking meals and baking bread, planting and tending a vegetable   garden, milking the goats and scrubbing soiled clothes on a washboard. But she   was happy. Her family and their well-being were her highest priority.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Every day   after chores and school, Reuben scoured the town, collecting the hessian nail   bags. On the day the two-room school closed for the summer, no student was more   delighted than Reuben. Now he would have more time for his mission.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>All summer   long, despite chores at home weeding and watering the garden, cutting wood and   fetching water―Reuben kept to his secret task.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Then all too   soon the garden was harvested, the vegetables canned and stored, and the school   reopened. Soon the leaves fell and the winds blew cold and gusty from the bay.   Reuben wandered the streets, diligently searching for his hessian   treasures.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Often he was   cold, tired and hungry, but the thought of the object in the shop window   sustained him. Sometimes his mother would ask: "Reuben, where were you? We were   waiting for you to have dinner."</FONT></P>  <P align=right><FONT face=Arial><IMG   style="BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 0px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 0px solid; BORDER-TOP: #000000 0px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 0px solid"   id=2316685 title="" border=0 alt="Almond-shaped brooch 一份爱的礼物" align=right   src="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/language_tips/book/attachement/jpg/site1/20100325/0013729e41a90d1544cc0a.jpg"   width=250 height=323 md5="" sourcedescription="编辑提供的本地文件"   sourcename="本地文件"></FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"Playing,   Mum. Sorry."</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Dora would   look at his face and shake her head. Boys.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Finally   spring burst into glorious green and Reuben's spirits erupted. The time had   come! He ran into the barn, climbed to the hayloft and uncovered the tin can. He   poured the coins out and began to count.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Then he   counted again. He needed 20 cents more. Could there be any sacks left any where   in town? He had to find four and sell them before the day ended.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Reuben ran   down Water Street.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>The shadows   were lengthening when Reuben arrived at the factory. The sack buyer was about to   lock up.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"Mister!   Please don't close up yet."</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>The man   turned and saw Reuben, dirty and sweat stained.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"Come back   tomorrow, boy."</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"Please,   Mister. I have to sell the sacks now―please."The man heard a tremor in Reuben's   voice and could tell he was close to tears.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"Why do you   need this money so badly?"</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"It's a   secret."</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>The man took   the sacks, reached into his pocket and put four coins in Reuben's hand. Reuben   murmured a thank you and ran home.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Then,   clutching the tin can, he headed for the shop.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"I have the   money," he solemnly told the owner.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>The man went   to the window and retrieved Reuben's treasure.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>He wiped the   dust off and gently wrapped it in brown paper. Then he placed the parcel in   Reuben's hands.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Racing home,   Reuben burst through the front door. His mother was scrubbing the kitchen stove.   "Here, Mum! Here!" Reuben exclaimed as he ran to her side. He placed a small box   in her work roughened hand.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>She unwrapped   it carefully, to save the paper. A blue-velvet jewel box appeared. Dora lifted   the lid, tears beginning to blur her vision.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>In gold   lettering on a small, almond-shaped brooch was the word Mother.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>It was   Mother's Day, 1946.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Dora had   never received such a gift; she had no finery except her wedding ring.   Speechless, she smiled radiantly and gathered her son into her   arms.</FONT></P></DIV></DIV></div>
