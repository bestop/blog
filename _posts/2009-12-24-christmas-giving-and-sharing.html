  <div><DIV>  <P><STRONG><FONT style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt" size=3 face=Arial>The spirit of giving   and sharing - not only this Christmas season but all year   round</FONT></STRONG></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>The spirit of giving and sharing is at its peak during the   Christmas season. People are so generous to dole out gifts, money and other   things to people they care about, and at times to charity, too. This innate   feeling in us is always there. It's not only for special seasons like the   holidays that we should be able to give and share whatever we have in abundance.   It must likely be the instinctive feeling in us that we should be willing to   share and give something all year round especially to those who are in   need.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>The holiday feeling is all around us. The malls are all   decorated with pretty and shiny Christmas decors all around. There's happy   Christmas music being heard all over the place. A lot of people are shopping   because there are lots of sales and discounts offered. The traffic has gone from   bad to worse and more people line up in the bank to get money for their shopping   spree. Everybody seems to be in a happy mood complementing the Christmas holiday   feeling.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>Okay, this is the season where there is a lot of sharing and   giving. We would be having parties in our companies and family gatherings where   we would have gifts for everybody. There would be plenty of good and delicious   foods around and the merry making would last till late into the night. Having   said that, we may have to stop for a while and think why we are all in the   celebration mood. It's Christmas and it's Jesus' birthday and that alone is   enough reason to celebrate.</FONT></P>  <P align=center><FONT face=Arial></FONT>  <CENTER><FONT face=Arial><IMG style="WIDTH: 450px; HEIGHT: 338px" id=2083813   title="" border=0 alt=圣诞节：奉献与分享 align=center   src="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/language_tips/book/attachement/jpg/site1/20091224/0013729e41a90c9d456f42.jpg"   zmxid="zoomXimageId6" md5="" sourcedescription="编辑提供的本地文件"   sourcename="本地文件"></FONT></CENTER>  <P><FONT face=Arial></FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>However, if we take time to find the other meaning of   Christmas in its simplest term, it is a season to thank God for everything we   have for this year. It would be nice to give back to Him through the spirit of   sharing and giving to those who are less fortunate in their life.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>In my church, our parish priest encourages all parishioners   to share some of their blessings to people who have less. There are requests for   used clothing, some canned goods and other goodies stuff to be donated to some   charities. The usual charities would be children's orphanages, home for the   aged, for prisoners in a nearby prison area and for the sick that are still   confined in government hospitals. The response has always been very positive and   our parish priest can only express gratitude by blessing all of us in church and   promising to pray for all of us throughout his lifetime. That would be truly   reassuring since we have in our community many priests aside from our main   parish priest who would continuously pray for all of us!</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>The spirit of sharing and giving is innate in all of us. It   is just a matter of discovering it in you and finding this deep inside you. If   you have found it in your heart to share and give not only during Christmas, but   every time you are have the chance to do so, then you are so blessed. I truly   believe that giving even only a little is already a lot of help. That   wholeheartedness of sharing and giving would come back to you in some other way.   You'd be surprised that more blessings would come your way. It may be an   unexpected promotion, some problems being solved on their own, some financial   help coming from somewhere unexpectedly and a lot more. I'm speaking from   experience. I've been blessed so many times from this sharing and giving habit   that I have in me.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>I try to give what I can no matter how little. I do this   thru my church. Everything goes with a prayer that hopefully the people who get   these little things would be happy even only for a while. That thought makes me   happy, feeling at peace that somehow I was able to do something for people even   though I don't know them.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>Hopefully, everybody would give a little help. The spirit of   sharing and giving doesn't mean that you are spoiling these people thru charity.   It's not that; it's just that these people may feel helpless at times, hopeless   most of the time and this is where we can come in, that we can show them that we   care, we can give them hope and something to live for in their life. It is our   way of showing them that their life is worth caring for so that they should be   inspired to do better in their life. Thankfully, there is always the goodness in   all of us; all we have to do is make use of it this Christmas and through out   the years to come.</FONT></P></DIV></div>
