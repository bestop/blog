  <div class="post"><h2>{{ page.title }}</h2><strong>{{ page.date | date_to_long_string }}</strong><div><DIV>  <DIV class=3jbiaoti><FONT size=2 face="Comic Sans MS">After four trains and a   wrong turn in Florence, I was in Siena, Italy, carrying too much luggage and   struggling for words I didn't know. It was November, and I was going by myself   to a city with tones so unusually rich, a color is named for it.</FONT></DIV>  <DIV class=3jineiwen>  <P><FONT size=2 face="Comic Sans MS">The family I was to stay with, a relatively   elderly mother and her twice-my-age son, didn't speak a word of English and   weren't expected to. I was the one who was supposed to learn a language; I was   to go to Italian class three hours a day for the next month. But the day I got   there, all I knew was "Non parlo italiano," and I said it all the time.   </FONT></P>  <P><FONT size=2 face="Comic Sans MS">The family was short with me at first, and   I understood enough to figure out the words for "that's the thing with   Americans, they don't know how to speak." But it would be they who would teach   me most of the Italian I learned there―and a few added lessons along the   way.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT size=2 face="Comic Sans MS">I went to Siena for a few good reasons. I   left Chicago for a million more. I had just quit a job to go to graduate school,   and the people there resented me for it. I had just quit a boyfriend. And I had   quit an apartment where the landlord was a little too friendly. I was tired of   quitting things; I was ready for big, shining starts.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT size=2 face="Comic Sans MS">I picked Italy for its art, and Siena was   full of it. It was just so old. The town hall was built in the 12th century, and   all the other buildings weren't much younger. A thick high wall circled the town   as if the whole thing had been thrown like a 1)discus into the Tuscan hills. The   Duomo was made of ancient striped marble, and St. Catherine's skull was in a   church named for her, where it's been for 600 years. Everything was 2)medieval   and preserved, and nothing was like where I came from.</FONT></P>  <P><BR><FONT size=2 face="Comic Sans MS">The first morning of class, my   host-mother, Signora Franci, escorted me on the bus so I wouldn't get lost. She   was about 4-foot-11 to my 5-9 and she talked continually to me in Italian,   though she knew I was still 3)oblivious. She left me at the Dante Aleghieri   language school with a tip-toed kiss and a "Ciao, bella." I could love a country   where absolutely everyone called you beautiful.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT size=2 face="Comic Sans MS">My class was a stray collection of   21-year-old Australian girls. I took them on as my friends; we'd circle through   the city after class every day, then sit in the town square, dodging pigeons and   eating gelato.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT size=2 face="Comic Sans MS">But I suddenly wasn't good at having   friends. Something from the month before had made me shy. I wasn't very happy   about people in general and it showed with these women. I questioned when they   were nice to me and 4)bristled when they whispered about anything. I was sure I   was just weird to them, some older, freaked-out American who trusted no   one.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT size=2 face="Comic Sans MS">And my boyfriend had been tricky. Yes, we   broke up before I left, but the actual night before I got on the plane, he gave   me presents and talked about missing me. So now I missed him.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT size=2 face="Comic Sans MS">I went to Rome to look at the Sistine   Chapel, and I called him from a pay phone in front of St. Peter's to describe   every detail. He screamed things back to me: "What are you doing there without   me?" "When are you coming home?" And it rained the whole time and some guy   grabbed my butt right there in Vatican City, but I didn't care. I felt filled up   with Michelangelo and a boy and bringing worlds together.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT size=2 face="Comic Sans MS">But all that rain wasn't good for me. Back   in Siena, I woke up the next morning and I couldn't stand up. Being sick is the   one thing that can make you feel completely alone; and that was a feeling I   didn't need reinforced. When I wasn't up for school, Signora Franci came into my   dark, blue room. "Io sento malo," I told her. I felt bad. She immediately   started rushing around, yelling at her son to call the doctor. I understood that   much, but events were out of my hands. I lay in bed and she brought things to   me: a hot water bottle, tea, soup.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT size=2 face="Comic Sans MS">I wondered how she could be so concerned,   not knowing me, not even knowing my words. But I was so far away from home, I   never needed taking care of so badly. I stared at that ceiling, and thought   about every friend, every boyfriend, I ever lost too soon. I could see all the   people I missed now. The people who hurt me, the people I didn't understand,   just drifted away.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT size=2 face="Comic Sans MS">Hours later, Signora Franci came in again,   this time with green 5)velvet slippers she had bought because I always walked   around in socks. She said something I equated as: Of course you're going to get   sick if you have cold feet all the time―warm them. "Mille grazie," I said. But a   day later, when I was feeling better much sooner than I thought I would, I   wanted to thank her more.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT size=2 face="Comic Sans MS">It was three weeks into the trip, and she   had made me realize why I came to Italy. It wasn't just to see art―though I saw   it, and it made me feel creative and part of history and enriched. And it wasn't   just to get away. What I needed, and what I never got from sweet Australians or   kind teachers, was the returned belief in basic human kindness. Signora Franci   didn't take care of me because of anything else but basic human concern: Someone   is sick, she's away from her home, make her better. I was 25 years old, I had   just started seeing more bad in people than good―and I needed to see that   kindness in action.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT size=2 face="Comic Sans MS">In my last week in Siena, I just took in   the medieval walls, the green narrow hills and the wet, wet air. My Italian   class performed a terrible spoken version of "Don Giovanni" for the whole   school. I rode to other hill towns on huge buses with my Aussie friends, and the   last night we drank wine and wandered through the streets yelling phrase-book   expressions at each other.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT size=2 face="Comic Sans MS">Days before I went home, I knew I'd be   ready for it. There were people to get back to, and I knew who they were.   People, in general, could be terrible and wonderful. Sad that I had to go to   Italy to realize that. Amazing that I   could.<BR></FONT></P></DIV></DIV></div>
