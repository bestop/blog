  <div><DIV><FONT size=2>  <DIV class=sanjiriqi>Often we're told that we have to suffer now ― give up what   we want ― in order to succeed later, that in order to save we must sacrifice.   Give up instant gratification to get delayed gratification.</DIV>  <DIV class=sanjineiwen>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px">But you can do both.</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px">For years, I was confused about this, as I read   books and websites that sent me two different messages:</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><STRONG>Pleasure later.</STRONG> The first   message was that in order to be successful, in order to build wealth, you have   to delay gratification. You can't have instant gratification and be   successful.</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><STRONG>Pleasure now.</STRONG> The second   message was usually from other sources on Happiness, but sometimes from the same   source: enjoy life now, while you can, because it's short and you never know   when your last day will come. Live every day like it's your last. Trouble is, I   agree with both messages. And if you read this site often, you'll see that I   send both messages: Live frugally and simply! But also enjoy life!</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px">That's because I've reconciled the two   philosophies into one: Live life now and enjoy it to the fullest ― without   destroying your future. The key to doing that? Find ways to enjoy life   completely, utterly, maximally … that don't cost your future very much.</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px">Here are some tips for actually living that   philosophy:</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><STRONG>Find free or cheap pleasures.</STRONG>   Frugality does not have to be boring or restrictive … if you use your   imagination. Be creative and find ways to have fun ― loads of it ― without   spending much money. Have a picnic at the park, go to the beach, do crafts,   board games, fly a kite, make art, bake cookies … I could list a hundred things,   and you could come up with a few hundred more. Make a list of simple pleasures,   and enjoy them to the maximum. This is the key to the whole idea of enjoying   life now without spending tomorrow's dollar. See Savor the Little Things .</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><STRONG>Make simplifying fun.</STRONG> I'm a big   fan of simplifying my life, from decluttering to creating a simple lifestyle in   every way. And to me, this is great fun. I get rid of stuff (and possibly make   money selling it) and have a blast doing it. That's good math.</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><STRONG>Rediscover what's important.</STRONG>   Oftentimes we spend tons of money, shopping, going out, watching movies, eating   out … without really enjoying life. And when we stop to think about it, we never   have time for the things we really want to do. Well, that's probably because   your life is filled with things that aren't very important to you. Instead, step   back and really think about what's important to you. Then get rid of the other   (expensive) stuff, and focus on what's important. Listen to some stuff on my   list: my wife and kids, other friends and family, reading, writing, exercising,   volunteering, spending quiet time in contemplation. Guess how many of those   things cost a lot of money?

If   you give "stuff" a priority ― stuff like gadgets, nice furnishings, nice   clothes, shoes, jewelry, etc. ― then you will spend a lot of money. But if you   make people a priority ― the people you love most, you close friends and family   ― you don't need to spend a dime to enjoy life. Make some time to visit with   friends, or your parents … and have a conversation with them that doesn't   involve eating out or going to the movies. Just sit, have some iced tea or hot   cocoa (depending on the weather), and talk. Tell jokes and laugh your heads off.   Talk about books you've read, movies you've watched, new things going on in your   life, your hopes and dreams. And make time for your kids or your significant   other ― really spend time with them, doing things that don't cost money. (See   Spend Time with Family and Loved Ones , 100 Ways to Have Fun With Your Kids and   50 Ways to Be Romantic on the Cheap .)</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><STRONG>Find time for yourself.</STRONG> Make   time every day, and every week, to spend time alone. It really gives more   meaning and enjoyment to your life, rather than rushing through life with no   time to think, to breathe. For ideas on how to make this time, see these ways to   create time for solitude .</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><STRONG>Sometimes, splurge.</STRONG> You   shouldn't restrict yourself from expensive pleasures all the time ― it's not   good to develop the feeling of deprivation. To prevent that, once in awhile, buy   yourself something … or better yet, give yourself a decadent treat. I love   things with dark chocolate or berries. Crepes with ice cream and berries are one   of my favorites. Just don't go overboard … and learn to enjoy the splurge to the   fullest. If you truly take the time to enjoy a treat, you don't need a lot of   it.</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><STRONG>Track your successes.</STRONG> It   doesn't really matter how you track your success … you can use gold stars for   creating a new simplifying or frugalfying habit, or a spreadsheet chart to track   your decreasing debt and increasing savings or investments. Tracking is a great   way to not only provide motivation, but make the process of changing fun.</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><STRONG>Reward yourself.</STRONG> And in order   to make it more fun, celebrate every little success! Set rewards for yourself   (hopefully not too expensive!) along your path to success ― celebrate one day,   two days, three days, a week, two weeks, three, a month … you get the idea.</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><STRONG>Volunteer.</STRONG> One of the most   rewarding things for my family has been when we have managed to volunteer. It's   actually something we only started doing last year, but since then, we've done   it a bunch of times in a number of different ways. And while it doesn't cost a   dime, it is tremendously satisfying in ways that money could never buy. Read   more .</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><STRONG>Live in the moment.</STRONG> Learn to   think not so much about the past or future, but about what you are going through   right now. Be present. It may seem trite, but it's the key to enjoying life to   the fullest ― without having to spend money. Think about it ― you can spend   money on eating out, but if you are not really thinking about what you're   eating, you may not enjoy it much at all. But if you cook a simple but delicious   meal, and really taste every bite, it can be tremendously enjoyable without   costing a lot.

Ever think about how quickly a week, a month, or a year goes by?   Perhaps you're in the fast lane too much. Try slowing down, and things will be   less stressful and more enjoyable. Drive slower , eat slower , live slower .</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><STRONG>Learn to find cheap, cool   stuff.</STRONG> Call me crazy, but I love shopping at thrift stores. You can   find so many cool things there, and it costs so little. Garage sales are the   same way.
