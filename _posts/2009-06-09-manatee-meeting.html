Moments   later a broad nose emerged and exhaled in a great snuffling breath. It was a   manatee, and by the looks of the reddish-colored water and the way it was   thrashing, it was in trouble.</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px; TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt">I had often watched manatees   in these warm coastal waters, but I'd never seen one act like this before.   Usually just their big nostrils appeared for a gulp of air as they foraged on   sea grasses or swam slowly to greener underwater pastures. But I also knew how   common it was for these lumbering giants to be gashed by boat propellers or   entangled in crab traps.</P>  <P align=right><IMG id=1560641 title=""   style="BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 0px solid; BORDER-TOP: #000000 0px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 0px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 0px solid"   height=201 alt="Manatee meeting 邂逅海牛"   src="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/language_tips/book/attachement/jpg/site1/20090604/0013729e41a90b91c4ff36.jpg"   width=338 align=right border=0 sourcedescription="编辑提供的本地文件"   sourcename="本地文件"></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px; TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt">I wanted to help, but what   could I do? There was no one else on the beach, and the nearest phone to call   the Marine Patrol was miles away.</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px; TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt">Tossing my beach bag onto   the sand, I began wading toward the animal, who continued to writhe as if in   distress. I was still only waist deep when I came close enough to make out the   bristly whiskers on the manatee's muzzle as it thrust up out of the sea. Then,   to my surprise, a second muzzle, much smaller, poked up beside it.</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px; TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt">I pushed on through the   shoal water, but now the manatees were also moving toward me. Before I knew what   was happening, I was in chest-deep water encircled by not one or two, but at   least three blimplike bodies. I felt elated and slightly dizzy like the kid who   is 'it' in a schoolyard game.</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px; TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt">A bulbous snout emerged next   to me. In the translucent water, I could clearly see the rest of the huge   mammal, and there, nestled close behind her, a smaller version of her massive   body.</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px; TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt">Then, with incredible   gentleness for such an enormous creature, the larger manatee nudged the little   one with her paddle-shaped flipper and pushed it to the surface beside me. I   wanted to reach out and touch the pudgy sea baby, but I hesitated, not knowing   the rules of this inter-species encounter.</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px; TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt">As the two slipped back   underwater, two other manatees moved in from behind and slid by, one on either   side, rubbing gently against my body as they swam past. They circled and   repeated the action, this time followed by the mother and her calf. Emboldened   by their overtures, I let my hand graze the side of the small manatee, now   clinging to the mother's back, as they made their pass. Its skin felt rubbery   and firm like an old fashioned hot water bottle.</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px; TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt">The group completed several   more circuits. Since they obviously enjoyed touching me, I began stroking each   of them as they sidled by. When one of them rolled over for a scratch, I knew I   had made the right move.</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px; TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt">Eventually my new friends   made their way off towards deeper water. I stood anchored to the spot, not   wishing to break the spell, until finally the rising tide forced me back to   shore.</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px; TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt">I suppose I will never know   exactly what took place that morning. I like to think that the manatees included   me in their celebration of a birth; that I was welcomed to meet the newest   member of their tribe. But over time I have come to cherish the experience   without questions.</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px; TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt">During that unexpected   rendezvous, I felt more in tune with the rhythms of life on this vast planet   than I ever have. The memory has become a song I sing to myself when I have the   blues, a dance I do to celebrate joy.</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px; TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt">And each year, during the   last week of May, I pack a lunch and head for that isolated stretch of beach for   a quiet little birthday picnic on the shore. After all, you never know who might   show up for the party.</P></FONT></DIV></div>
