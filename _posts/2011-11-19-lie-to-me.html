Here we present some of the most popular<br>and interesting lies.<br>每个人都说过谎。一个恰当的谎言可能会挽回一段恋情，化解一个尴尬场面，或是为我们赢得宝贵的时间。男人对女人说谎，女人也对男人说谎。据说人们最爱拿&quot;手机没信号&quot;当借口了，你同意吗？今天我们就精心挑选了一些最常见最有趣的谎言跟大家一起分享。<p>[女人篇]<br>There are crucial differences in the lies women and men tell.

Men lie to build themselves up or to conceal something, the<br>study shows.<br>研究显示，比较而言，男人撒谎的根本出发点源自男性自我的一面：或是为了树立高大形象，或是为了掩饰。<p>1.I like your friends.<br>我喜欢你那些朋友。<br>2.You don&#39;t look fat in that dress.<br>你穿那条裙子不显胖。<br>3.Yes, I cleaned up already.<br>是的，我已经打扫过了。<br>4.She&#39;s just my friend.

They try to protect you<br>by shielding you from the possibility of failure, which also shields<br>you from the possibility of making your dreams a reality.<br>身边的人给你的热心建议可能并非都是&quot;忠言&quot;。他们试图保护你，使你远离任何失败的风险。殊不知，这样一来，你通往实现梦想的路也被堵死了。<p>1.You&#39;re totally screwed if it doesn&#39;t work out.<br>这事儿要是不成你就完了。<br>2.That&#39;s impossible.<br>那是不可能的。<br>3.Only a lucky few &quot;make it.&quot;<br>只有少数的幸运儿才能成功。<br>4.You need more money saved before you can take the first step.<br>你需要再多攒些钱才能开始行动。<br>5.It&#39;s safer to stay at your day job.<br>还是继续做你现在的工作保险点儿。<br>6.You might fail.
