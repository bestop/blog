description: 就为了今天，我会很快乐；就为了今天，我将磨练自己的意志；就为了今天，我会制定一个计划……昨天，今天，明天， 也许选择今天最为明智。昨天已经过去，明天还未到来，唯有把握每一个今天，笑对今天，才是人生之一大真谛。Just for today I will try to live through this day on

  <div><br /><p>就为了今天，我会很快乐；就为了今天，我将磨练自己的意志；就为了今天，我会制定一个计划……</p><br /><p style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px">昨天，今天，明天， 也许选择今天最为明智。昨天已经过去，明天还未到来，唯有把握每一个今天，笑对今天，才是人生之一大真谛。</p><br /><p style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px">Just for today I will try to live through this day only and not tackle my whole life problem at once. I can do something for twelve hours that would appall me if I had to keep it up for a lifetime.</p><br /><p style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px">Just for today I will be happy. This assumes to be true what Abraham Lincoln said, that "Most folks are as happy as they make up their minds to be."</p><br /><p style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px">Just for today I will adjust myself to what is, and not try to adjust everything to my own desires. I will take my "luck" as it comes.</p><br /><p style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px">Just for today I will try to strengthen my mind. I will study. I will learn something useful. I will not be a mental loafer. I will read something that requires effort, thought and concentration.</p><br /><p style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px">Just for today I will exercise my soul in three ways. I will do somebody a good turn and not get found out: If anybody knows of it, it will not count. I will do at least two things I don't want to do-just for exercise. I will not show anyone that my feelings are hurt: they may be hurt, but today I will not show it.</p><br /><p style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px">Just for today I will be agreeable. I will look as well as I can, dress becomingly, talk low, act courteously, criticize not one bit, and try not to improve or regulate anybody but myself.</p><br /><p style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px">Just for today I will have a program, I may not follow it exactly, but I will have it. I will save myself from two pests: hurry and indecision.</p><br /><p style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px">Just for today I will have a quiet half hour all by myself and relax. During this half hour, sometime, I will try to get a better perspective of my life.</p><br /><p style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px">Just for today I will be unafraid. Especially I will not be afraid to enjoy what is beautiful, and to believe that as I give to the world, so the world will give to me.</p><br /></div>
