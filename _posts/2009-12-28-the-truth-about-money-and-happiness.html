  <div><DIV>  <DIV class=sanjiriqi><FONT face=Arial>It is an oft repeated axiom that money   cannot buy happiness. While this is certainly true, poverty will not buy   Happiness either. Some people become very wealthy, yet struggle to enjoy their   lives. On the other hand, others manage to go through life with very few money   problems simply because they are able to make the most of what they   have.</FONT></DIV>  <DIV class=sanjineiwen>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Ideally you should try to   combine both prosperity and Happiness. To do this I recommend the following   steps:</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>1. Learn to Value Simplicity   The aim of life should not be to accumulate as many possessions and as much   wealth as possible. We should learn to be content with what we have and   appreciate the benefits of simplicity. For example, if we clear out our   unnecessary clutter we will achieve a greater feeling of space and   freedom.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>If you feel happiness is   directly related to material possessions, you are making a mistake. Happiness   can be gained just through being content with a small amount of possessions. Our   inner wealth is not just about what we have, but what we are content to live   without.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>2. Do Not Be Attached to Your   Money Does it pain you to spend your own money - even if it is for something   useful? Even someone like Bill Gates can feel uncomfortable spending his   billions; it is said he used to always travel economy class because he didn't   see the need to spend more money on first class. The problem with this, however,   is that if we are always reluctant to spend money we miss the whole point of   earning it.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>A good attitude is to see money   as a circular flow - that is, spending money enables more to come into our   lives. It is not like a big dam where we just try to hold onto it all. We need   to let the money out by spending on useful and necessary things. It is no good   having a stockpile of water unless we use it to generate power; similarly it is   no use accumulating large savings if we we feel miserable spending   it.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>3. Minimize Money Worries We   will be happiest if we can make money a small part of our lives, and think about   money issues as little as possible. To be able to do this we need to avoid   creating situations of debt as getting out of debt can be difficult and   stressful. Learn to live within your means by avoiding impulsive overspending.   If you do need to go into debt, plan ahead and find a loan which is clear and   manageable to repay.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Try to avoid complicated and   risky investment plans; these give you the potential to gain more, but you will   also have the potential to lose a lot more. Good financial planning should be   simple and well balanced; this means your nerves will not be affected by   worrying about the outcome of your investment. It is better to invest and save   in something secure so you can forget about it and not worry   endlessly.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>4. Avoid Jealousy No matter how   much money you have, do you still envy people who have more? A recent survey   asked people whether they would prefer to have a salary above the national   average. Alternatively, they could choose to have a higher salary, but this   higher salary would be lower than the average. A surprising amount of people   chose to have a lower salary as long as it meant they were relatively better off   than the rest of the population.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>To me this makes no sense. If   other people become wealthier than you, that is no reason to be unhappy. If   other people are prosperous that is good; don't feel miserable just because you   cannot keep up with the Joneses.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>5. Don't Live to Work. Do you   find yourself working overtime in the evenings and at the weekend? If you spend   all your time working, you will have no opportunity to spend your earnings.   Don't feel guilty for turning extra work down; it is important to give leisure   time as high a priority as work. It is good if we can gain satisfaction from   work, but if we only spend time working then our life lacks a proper   balance.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>6. Understand Why Are Some   People Always Poor I'm sure most people will have good friends who always seems   to have money concerns. No matter what happens they always seem to be short of   money and they frequently share tales of financial woe. The lack of money makes   them unhappy, but they don't know how to change the situation. Giving them money   doesn't solve the problem because they continue to make bad financial   decisions.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Part of the problem lies in   their mindset. It is easy to become accustomed to being poor and then half   expecting the poverty to continue. With this mindset, it becomes difficult to   attract money into our lives and easy to develop feelings of self pity and   regret. However, while we might be unfortunate it won't do anything to resolve   the situation. The secret is to try and change our habits and approach to money.   Also, be wary about trying to convert others to better financial habits - it is   almost guaranteed to fail.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>7. Ignorance is Not Bliss   Another attitude to money is to try and avoid thinking about it. We ignore the   true extent of our debts, spending and leaving unpaid bills. We frequently miss   out on moving to better financial deals and make late payments which harm our   credit rating. By ignoring money like this, we merely create more serious   problems for the future.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Also, when we put off dealing   with financial problems we carry the problem in the back of our mind. We can get   no peace of mind because we permanently have a long list of things to deal with.   It is better in these circumstances to promptly deal with things like paying   bills and sorting out your accounts - then we can forget about them.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>8. Develop A New Perspective   The following are some money related questions you should ask   yourself:</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Am I happy with my financial   situation? Would more money make my life better? Do I always have financial   problems hanging over my head? Is money the most important thing in my life? Is   the pursuit of money making me miserable? Would I sacrifice principles to make   more money? Even just answering these questions honestly may encourage a new   perspective towards money.</FONT></P></DIV></DIV></div>
