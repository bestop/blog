I suspect that you're too young to understand what "adult" means, so let   me explain. It means that I'm taller than you, and smarter, and that I get to do   lots of awesome things, like smoke cigarettes and ovulate. It also means that I   like to take naps on airplanes and read my newspaper in silence. These things   seem to be very different from the things that you like to do.</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px; TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt">I've gleaned from its   near-constant utterance by the woman sitting next to you―your mother, I suppose,   or perhaps a social worker or a federal prisoner who's being paid to spend time   with you―that your name is Timmy. It's probably Timothy, actually, but people   call you Timmy because it's cuter. Which is appropriate, Timmy, because you're   very cute, you really are.</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px; TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt">I'm going to drink this cup   of coffee―would you like some? I didn't think so. You're more of a juice-box   man, from what I gather. The way I gather this is by looking at the stain on my   ninety-eight-dollar pants, the one you made when you put your juice box there.   If I touched your pants, Timmy, I would probably be sent to jail. There are lots   of differences between you and me, but that's one of the big ones: the quality   and the seriousness of what happens when we touch other people's pants.</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px; TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt">You're not much of a   sleeper, are you, Timmy? We've just met, but it seems to me like maybe you don't   really enjoy sleeping all that much. In fact, it seems to me that one of your   greatest joys in life is wakefulness―and not simply passive wakefulness but the   kind of vigorous wakefulness that makes a person like me start to question the   very possibility of silence as a condition that can exist in the universe. I can   see that I've confused you, Timmy, and I apologize; I was only trying to point   out that you really seem to enjoy being awake. Let me make it up to you by   giving you this modest dose of Ambien. It's a kind of candy for your soul. Your   soul is a kind of mouth that's inside your brain.</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px; TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt">Here comes the nice   stewardess lady with a bag for collecting people's garbage. Would you like me to   give her some of the garbage that's strewn all over your seat―and, if we're   being perfectly honest here, Timmy, all over my seat as well? And, while we're   at it, maybe I could give her this talking doll―the one that sings songs, very   loud songs, songs of terrifying and ungodly volume, from that animated movie   about adventurous insects. It's not that I don't love the doll; it's just that   I'm pretty sure it's illegal for children to carry such things on airplanes.   Have you heard of terrorism, Timothy? That's why it's illegal for you to have   this doll.</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px; TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt">Your whimpering and your   dripping facial parts suggest that perhaps this conversation has run its course,   so I'll let you get back to your finger painting, your fidgeting, and your   wanton, inexplicable shredding of the in-flight magazine. I'll be here in my   seat, fantasizing about hurtling my childless adult body out of the airplane and   into the sky. Enjoy the rest of the flight, Timmy. I've really enjoyed sitting   next to you. It's fun to make new friends.</P></FONT></DIV></div>
