  <div class="post"><h2>{{ page.title }}</h2><strong>{{ page.date | date_to_long_string }}</strong><div><DIV>  <DIV class=sanjineiwen>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>I believe it is important to   separate good failures from bad failures. Good failures happen when, even though   you made the correct decision, you still lost. Bad failures happen because you   made bad decisions, or worse, didn't make a decision at all. Although the two   feel the same, they have a completely different long-term impact.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>I'm a novice poker player. One   of the first things I learned was that there were good wins and bad wins. Good   wins were because you had a sound strategy of betting where the odds were in   your favor. Bad wins happened when you just got lucky. Going all-in on a 2-7   off-suit might win the hand. But it doesn't mean you're a good poker   player.</FONT></P>  <P align=left><FONT face=Arial><IMG style="WIDTH: 245px; HEIGHT: 244px"   id=907355 title="" border=0 alt="Why Failure Can Be Your Friend" align=left   src="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/language_tips/book/attachement/jpg/site1/20080724/0013729e42d209f2718001.jpg"   zmxid="zoomXimageId6" md5="" sourcedescription="编辑提供的本地文件"   sourcename="本地文件"></FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial></FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><STRONG><FONT face=Arial>Good   Failures</FONT></STRONG></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Mentally separating good   failures from bad failures takes work. Poker is a simple game where the laws of   probability are cleanly defined. Real life is a lot messier. It takes more   effort to decide which failures were because of a bad decision and which were   just the unintended side-effects of the best choice available.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Although it can be difficult to   separate the two, there are benefits to making two piles instead of just one. By   separating the two types of failures, it is easier to persevere through good   failures. It may hurt to have your Business proposal shut down for the fifteenth   time, but it isn't necessarily a bad failure.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>By separating the two, you can   also avoid more bad failures. If you fail because of laziness, indecision or   poor planning, you can quickly correct those in the future. Knowing the   difference between good and bad failures keeps you from repeating stupid   mistakes.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><STRONG><FONT face=Arial>Types of Good   Failures</FONT></STRONG></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>I've found that there are   several categories of good failures. These are the kinds of failures you might   actually seek out. Since they come from good, not bad, decisions, they are the   best way to fail.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>1. High Upside, Low   Downside</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>There are many areas of life   where the upside is far greater than the downside. When I write an article, it   takes about 90 minutes of work. If nobody comments or responds to that post,   then I've just wasted 90 minutes.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>However, if the article becomes   popular, it can bring in thousands of visitors to my website. Those thousands of   visitors translate into new readers who can get value from the website. In   addition, the extra traffic often results in a higher monthly income for   me.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Writing blog entries is an   example where failure is cheap and winning can be huge. I'd gladly take a dozen   or two dozen failures for a big hit. A post that doesn't get attention is a good   failure.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>2. Breaking Through Your   Limits</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>The only way you can know your   limits are to go past them. Occasionally I've committed myself to more work than   I can handle. The result is stress and, in extreme cases, complete burnout.   Doing more than you can handle on a regular basis is a recipe for a nervous   breakdown.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>However, if you don't test   those limits and occasionally go past them, you can never improve. You'll always   go slightly below your capacity, never reaching your possible potential. I don't   enjoy an exhausting schedule, but occasionally facing one ensures my   productivity muscles stay strong.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>3. Embarrassment and Smart   Risk-Taking</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>There are some situations where   failures and successes can't be separated. There is no action that will   guarantee you only get success. In these cases, it can be useful to ignore the   losses since the wins will make up for it.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Public Speaking is a great   example. Any chance you get to speak in public runs you the risk of   embarrassment. You might say something stupid. The audience might not like your   speech. But if you don't face those failures, it's impossible to deliver a   fantastic speech.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>4. Staying Inside Your Comfort   Zone</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>The only way to have a bad   failure is to stay put. If you are constantly experimenting and pushing beyond   your daily routine, any result is a good result. Avoiding the things that scare   you doesn't make you safe, it makes you weaker.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Over a year ago I took dance   classes. For a self-proclaimed geek, this was definitely a step outside my   comfort zone. I loved the class. Even though it was outside of my comfort zone,   I had a great time and learned something valuable. This wasn't a failure, but it   just as easily could have been. It's better to discourage laziness than   occasionally stumbling.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>5. Taking on Too Big a   Challenge</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>More than a few times I've set   goals that were nearly impossible to accomplish. I didn't have enough time to   reach the deadline and I had no idea what I was doing. Although setting   extremely difficult challenges results in a lot of failures, it keeps you   sharp.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>The ideal challenge level is   where success is possible, but only if you work incredibly hard. Unfortunately,   finding this sweet spot means you'll end up making some goals too hard and   others too easy. If you never fail at a big challenge it probably means most of   your goals have been set too easy.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Just as there are good and bad   failures, there are good and bad wins. I'd rather have a good failure than a bad   win. A bad win might feel nice in the short term, but it is damaging over the   big picture.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Do you have a personal example   of a good failure?
