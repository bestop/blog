  <div class="post"><h2>{{ page.title }}</h2><strong>{{ page.date | date_to_long_string }}</strong><div><p><strong><span style="font-family:arial;">Healthy and Fit </span></strong></p><br /><p><span style="font-family:arial;">The first goal common to all of us is health and energy. We all want to be healthy and fit, to have high levels of energy and to live free of pain and illness. Today, with the incredible advances in medical science, the quality of our health and fitness, and our lifespan, is largely determined by design, not by chance. People with excellent health habits are far healthier, have more energy, and live longer and better than people who have poor health habits.</span></p><br /><p align="left"><span style="font-family:arial;"><img style="BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 0px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 0px solid; BORDER-TOP: #000000 0px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 0px solid" id="3651135" title="" border="0" alt="完美人生四大目标" align="right" src="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/language_tips/book/attachement/jpg/site1/20110321/0023ae731d750ef14a4c2b.jpg" width="300" height="289" sourcename="本地文件" sourcedescription="编辑提供的本地文件" md5="" /></span></p><br /><p><strong><span style="font-family:arial;">Excellent Relationships </span></strong></p><br /><p><span style="font-family:arial;">The second goal that we all have in common is to enjoy excellent relationships--intimate, personal or social--with the people we like and respect, and who like, love and respect us in turn. Fully 85% of your happiness will be determined by the quality of your relationships at each stage, and in each area, of your life. How well you get along with people, and how much they like, love and respect you, has more impact on the quality of your life than perhaps any other factor.</span></p><br /><p><strong><span style="font-family:arial;">Do What You Love </span></strong></p><br /><p><span style="font-family:arial;">The third common goal is to do work that we enjoy, to do it well, and to be well paid for it. You want to be able to get and keep the job you want, to get paid more and promoted faster. You want to earn the very most that is possible for you at each stage of your career, whatever you do.</span></p><br /><p><strong><span style="font-family:arial;">Achieve Financial Independence </span></strong></p><br /><p><span style="font-family:arial;">The fourth goal we all have in common is to achieve financial independence. You want to reach the point in life where you have enough money so that you never have to worry about money again. You want to be completely free of financial worries. You want to be able to order dinner in a restaurant without using the price listings to determine what you want to eat.</span></p><br /><p><span style="font-family:arial;">If you can dream it, you can achieve it! </span></p></div>
