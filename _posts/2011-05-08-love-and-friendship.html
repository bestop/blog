And both are so   dissimilar! What are the differences between friendship and love? Is platonic   friendship possible between persons of opposite sex? Let us try and   understand.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>What is friendship? Why do we call a person our friend? When   do we call someone a very good friend? If we care for a person, if we are always   ready to help that person and if we share most of our thoughts with a person,   they are our good friends. We can always count upon our good friends in an   emergency. We are always sure that our friend will understand why we acted in a   certain way. We need not explain anything to our very good friends. The   friendship is so deep and the relationship is so intimate, that most of the   things are automatically understood by our friends.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>What about love? In a relationship of deep love, all the   sharing that we discussed above are taken for granted. But love transcends all   this. During love, we are attached with a particular person, while in   friendship, one may have many friends. A loving relationship makes one so much   attached to the other, that one gets pained if his/her beloved is hurt! Love   also involves a physical element. Friendship does not have that. This is a vital   difference. Nature gives us love so that the specie can go forward. Nature does   not give us friendship.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>Your heart beats will never increase in anticipation of   meeting your friend. You will not lie awake at night thinking about your friend.   You will not feel totally lost, if you don't meet your friend for a few days.   You will not have dreams in your eyes thinking about your friend. But in love,   you will do all this and much more. Indeed, there is no comparison between love   and friendship.</FONT></P></DIV></DIV></div>
