  <div><DIV><FONT size=2>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px; TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt">Growing up, I always wanted   a dog. Probably because most of my friends had them, my favorite TV families had   them, and it just seemed normal, and American, to have a pooch in the house.</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px; TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt">My Dad is very clean. Not   just clean, I might say more Danny Tanner-ish in his habits. As in, he hoses   down the backyard, and front walkway, and even gets halfway down the street,   just for fun, until we have to yell, "Dad, you're wasting water! You can't hose   down the world!" Then he stops, and comes inside, and starts the very important   task of scrubbing the fingerprint smudges off the walls.</P>  <P align=right>&nbsp;</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px; TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt">So, no dog. When I was   eight, we moved across town to a larger house, with a pool, in a "safer"   neighborhood, in a gated community. With a large yard. I was very against   moving. Why, I cried, were we picking up and deserting everything and everyone   we knew and loved?! Our old house was great, we had an avocado tree, it was on a   super steep hill, what more could you want?! Well, in order to calm me down, I   guess, my parents told me that we could get a dog when we moved to the new,   barren home. I was sold. I quickly shut my trap.</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px; TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt">I feel it was serendipitous   that we didn't get a dog after the move. My parents said that I would never walk   it, which I vehemently denied, but which was probably true. And saying we would   get a dog and not following through was pretty much the ONLY thing my parents   ever promised that didn't happen in my life so far. I guilted them about it for   a few years, sobbing on holidays when I said "the only thing I want is a dog"   and refused presents. Then snuck them into my room on the sly.</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px; TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt">I am in my twenties now,   and our new roommate just moved in. She has a dog. A West Highland Terrier, or   Westie, as they are known. He is fluffy, but not too fluffy, small, but not too   small, white, but not too white. He is perfect.</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px; TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt">I don't even believe in   perfection really, but this dog is perfect for ME. Its the dog I always dreamt   of having, and it loves me as I knew a dog would. It follows me into the   bathroom when I shower. At first we would scare each other, I was not used to   having a non-human, living thing with a beating heart following me around and it   would surprise me around corners.</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px; TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt">Slowly, we got used to each   other. Now I can tell when the dog needs to go out, or when he just sees a few   birds in our yard. I give the doggie water, I walk him, and I teach him   boundaries. My boyfriend was impressed when I taught him how to lie in his bed   while the humans are eating, so as not to bother us. "I can't believe he listens   to you." As Cesar Millan would say, I am the Alpha Dog.</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px; TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt">In some ways, I am glad I   have (been forced to) wait until this age to have a dog around. I don't take him   for granted. I am happy every morning when I wake up and hear his little nails   clicking across the floor. We are a good match. I can see how a dog is not for   everyone. They are very needy and require a lot of attention and affection and   structure.</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px; TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt">Now my parents are   semi-retired but my Dad travels a lot for work. He's off to Luxembourg, Mexico,   or the Turks and Caicos every month. I ask my Mom if she would like a dog to   keep her company. She says no, she has a stepdog now (ours) and she can visit it   whenever she wants.</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px; TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt">And yes, my furry friend   will go with me wherever I want to go and whenever, he is very accomodating like   that.</P></FONT></DIV></div>
