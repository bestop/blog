  <div><DIV>  <DIV class=sanjineiwen>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px">The following story took place long ago in   Israel. One day when government officials were rebuilding a barn, they found a   mouse hole in a corner and used smoke to force the mice inside the hole to come   out. A while later they indeed saw mice running out, one after another.</P>  <P align=center>  <CENTER></CENTER>  <P></P>  <P></P>  <P></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px">Then, everyone thought that all the mice had   escaped. But just as they just about to start to clean up, they saw two mice   squeezing out at the exit of the hole. After some endeavor, the mice finally got   out. The strange thing was that after they came out of the hole, they did not   run away immediately. Instead, one chased after the other near the exit of the   hole. It seemed that one was trying to bite the tail of the other.</P>  <P align=center>  <CENTER><IMG style="WIDTH: 300px; HEIGHT: 200px" id=1104837 title="" border=0   hspace=0 alt="Unconditional Love 无条件的爱" align=center   src="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/language_tips/book/attachement/jpg/site1/20081205/0013729e42d20aa308df01.jpg"   width=300 height=200 zmxid="zoomXimageId6" md5="" sourcedescription="编辑提供的本地文件"   sourcename="本地文件"></CENTER>  <P></P>  <P></P>  <P></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px">Everyone was puzzled, so they stepped closer to   take a look. They realized that one of the mice was blind and could not see   anything, and the other one was trying to allow the blind mouse to bite on his   tail so he could pull the blind one with him to escape.</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px">After witnessing what happened, everyone was   speechless and lost in thought. During meal time, the group of people sat down   in a circle and started to chat about what happened to the two mice.</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px">One serious Rome official said: "I think the   relationship between those two mice was that of emperor and minister." The   others thought for a while and said: "That was why!" Thus the Rome official   showed his arrogance superciliously.</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px">A smart Israeli said: "I think the relationship   between those two mice was husband and wife." Again the others thought for a   while, and all felt it made sense; so they expressed assent. Therefore, the   Israeli's countenance showed self-satisfaction.</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px">A Chinese, who was accustomed to the firm   tradition of loyalty to parents, said: "I think the relationship between those   two mice was that of mother and son." Once again the others thought for a while,   and felt this was more reasonable. So they expressed assent yet another time.   Therefore, the face of the Chinese conveyed professional humility.</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px">At that moment, one pure-minded Samaritan who   was squatted on the ground resting his chin in his palms, bewilderedly looked at   other people, and asked: "Why did those two mice have to have a certain   relationship?"</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px">Suddenly, the atmosphere froze. Stupefied, the   group looked back at the Samaritan and remained speechless. The Rome official,   the Israeli and the Chinese who had spoken earlier all lowered their heads in   shame, and did not dare to respond.</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px">In fact, the true love is not established on   benefit, friendship and loyalty or blood relationship. Instead, it is based on   no relationship.</P></DIV></DIV></div>
