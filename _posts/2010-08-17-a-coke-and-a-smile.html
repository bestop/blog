  <div class="post"><h2>{{ page.title }}</h2><strong>{{ page.date | date_to_long_string }}</strong><div><DIV>  <DIV class=sanjineiwen>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>I know now   that the man who sat with me on the old wooden stairs that hot summer night over   thirty-five years ago was not a tall man. But to a five-year-old, he was a   giant. We sat side by side, watching the sun go down behind the old Texaco   service station across the busy street. A street that I was never allowed to   cross unless accompanied by an adult, or at the very least, an older   sibling.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT   face=Arial>Cherry-scented smoke from Grampy's pipe kept the hungry mosquitoes at   bay while gray, wispy swirls danced around our heads. Now and again, he blew a   smoke ring and laughed as I tried to target the hole with my finger. I, clad in   a cool summer nightie, and Grampy, his sleeveless T-shirt, sat watching the   traffic. We counted cars and tried to guess the color of the next one to turn   the corner.</FONT></P>  <P align=center><FONT face=Arial></FONT>  <DIV align=left><FONT face=Arial><IMG style="WIDTH: 382px; HEIGHT: 267px"   id=2162236 title="" border=0 alt="A coke and a smile 可乐与微笑" align=center   src="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/language_tips/book/attachement/jpg/site1/20100121/0013729e41a90cc235932e.jpg"   md5="" sourcedescription="编辑提供的本地文件" sourcename="本地文件"></FONT></DIV>  <P><FONT face=Arial></FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Once again, I   was caught in the middle of circumstances. The fourth born of six children, it   was not uncommon that I was either too young or too old for something. This   night I was both. While my two baby brothers slept inside the house, my three   older siblings played with friends around the corner, where I was not allowed to   go. I stayed with Grampy, and that was okay with me. I was where I wanted to be.   My grandfather was baby-sitting while my mother, father and grandmother went   out.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Thirsty?"   Grampy asked, never removing the pipe from his mouth.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>" Yes," was   my reply." How would you like to run over to the gas station there and get   yourself a bottle of coke?"</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>I couldn't   believe my ears. Had I heard right? Was he talking to me? On my family's modest   income, coke was not a part of our budget or diet. A few tantalizing sips was   all I had ever had, and certainly never my own bottle.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"Okay," I   replied shyly, already wondering how I would get across the street. Surely   Grampy was going to come with me.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Grampy   stretched his long leg out straight and reached his huge hand deep into the   pocket. I could hear the familiar jangling of the loose change he always   carried. Opening his fist, he exposed a mound of silver coins. There must have   been a million dollars there. He instructed me to pick out a dime. After he   deposited the rest of the change back into his pocket, he stood up.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"Okay," he   said, helping me down the stairs and to the curb, " I'm going to stay here and   keep an ear out for the babies. I'll tell you when it's safe to cross. You go   over to the coke machine, get your coke and come back out. Wait for me to tell   you when it's safe to cross back."</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>My heart   pounded. I clutched my dime tightly in my sweaty palm. Excitement took my breath   away.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Grampy held   my hand tightly. Together we looked up the street and down, and back up again.   He stepped off the curb and told me it was safe to cross. He let go of my hand   and I ran. I ran faster than I had ever run before. The street seemed wide. I   wondered if I would make it to the other side. Reaching the other side, I turned   to find Grampy. There he was, standing exactly where I had left him, smiling   proudly. I waved.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"Go on, hurry   up," he yelled.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>My heart   pounded wildly as I walked inside the dark garage.I had been inside the garage   before with my father. My surroundings were familiar. I heard the Coca-Cola   machine motor humming even before I saw it. I walked directly to the big old   red-and-white dispenser. I knew where to insert my dime. I had seen it done   before and had fantasized about this moment many times.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>The big old   monster greedily accepted my dime, and I heard the bottles shift. On tiptoes I   reached up and opened the heavy door. There they were: one neat row of thick   green bottles, necks staring directly at me, and ice cold from the   refrigeration. I held the door open with my shoulder and grabbed one. With a   quick yank, I pulled it free from its bondage. Another one immediately took its   place. The bottle was cold in my sweaty hands. I will never forget the feeling   of the cool glass on my skin. With two hands, I positioned the bottleneck under   the heavy brass opener that was bolted to the wall. The cap dropped into an old   wooden box, and I reached in to retrieve it. I was cold and bent in the middle,   but I knew I needed to have this souvenir. Coke in hand, I proudly marched back   out into the early evening dusk. Grampy was waiting patiently. He   smiled.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"Stop right   there," he yelled. One or two cars sped by me, and once again, Grampy stepped   off the curb."Come on, now," he said, "Run." I did. Cool brown foam sprayed my   hands."Don't ever do that alone," he warned. I held the coke bottle tightly,   fearful he would make me pour it into a cup, ruining this dream come true. He   didn't. One long swallow of the cold beverage cooled my sweating body. I don't   think I ever felt so proud.</FONT></P></DIV></DIV></div>
