  <div><div class="WordSection1">  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:11.25pt;line-height:16.5pt;background:white">  <span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:black">A little more than a year ago, on a trip to Nairobi, Kenya, some colleagues and I met a 12-year-old Masai boy named Richard Turere, who told us a fascinating story. His family raises   livestock on the edge of a vast national park, and one of the biggest challenges is protecting the animals from lions&#8212;especially at night. Richard had noticed that placing lamps in a field didn&#8217;t deter lion attacks, but when he walked the field with a torch,   the lions stayed away. From a young age, he&#8217;d been interested in electronics, teaching himself by, for example, taking apart his parents&#8217; radio. He used that experience to devise a system of lights that would turn on and off in sequence&#8212;using solar panels,   a car battery, and a motorcycle indicator box&#8212;and thereby create a sense of movement that he hoped would scare off the lions. He installed the lights, and the lions stopped attacking. Soon villages elsewhere in Kenya began installing Richard&#8217;s &#8220;lion lights.&#8221;</span><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:black"><o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:11.25pt;line-height:16.5pt;background:white">  <span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:black">The story was inspiring and worthy of the broader audience that our TED conference could offer, but on the surface, Richard seemed an unlikely candidate to give a TED Talk. He was   painfully shy. His English was halting. When he tried to describe his invention, the sentences tumbled out incoherently. And frankly, it was hard to imagine a preteenager standing on a stage in front of 1,400 people accustomed to hearing from polished speakers   such as Bill Gates, Sir Ken Robinson, and Jill Bolte Taylor.</span><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:black"><o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:11.25pt;line-height:16.5pt;background:white">  <span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:black">But Richard&#8217;s story was so compelling that we invited him to speak. In the months before the 2013 conference, we worked with him to frame his story&#8212;to find the right place to begin,   and to develop a succinct and logical arc of events. On the back of his invention Richard had won a scholarship to one of Kenya&#8217;s best schools, and there he had the chance to practice the talk several times in front of a live audience. It was critical that   he build his confidence to the point where his personality could shine through. When he finally gave his talk at TED, in Long Beach, you could tell he was nervous, but that only made him more engaging&#8212;people were hanging on his every word. The confidence was   there, and every time Richard smiled, the audience melted. When he finished, the response was instantaneous: a sustained standing ovation.</span><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:black"><o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:11.25pt;line-height:16.5pt;background:white">  <span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:black">Since the first TED conference, 30 years ago, speakers have run the gamut from political figures, musicians, and TV personalities who are completely at ease before a crowd to lesser-known   academics, scientists, and writers&#8212;some of whom feel deeply uncomfortable giving presentations. Over the years, we&#8217;ve sought to develop a process for helping inexperienced presenters to frame, practice, and deliver talks that people enjoy watching. It typically   begins six to nine months before the event, and involves cycles of devising (and revising) a script, repeated rehearsals, and plenty of fine-tuning. We&#8217;re continually tweaking our approach&#8212;because the art of public speaking is evolving in real time&#8212;but judging   by public response, our basic regimen works well: Since we began putting TED Talks online, in 2006, they&#8217;ve been viewed more than one billion times.</span><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:black"><o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:11.25pt;line-height:16.5pt;background:white">  <span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:black">On the basis of this experience, I&#8217;m convinced that giving a good talk is highly coachable. In a matter of hours, a speaker&#8217;s content and delivery can be transformed from muddled   to mesmerizing. And while my team&#8217;s experience has focused on TED&#8217;s 18-minutes-or-shorter format, the lessons we&#8217;ve learned are surely useful to other presenters&#8212;whether it&#8217;s a CEO doing an IPO road show, a brand manager unveiling a new product, or a start-up   pitching to VCs.</span><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:black"><o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:black">Frame Your Story</span></b><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:11.25pt;line-height:16.5pt;background:white">  <span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:black">There&#8217;s no way you can give a good talk unless you have something worth talking about. Conceptualizing and framing what you want to say is the most vital part of preparation.</span><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:black"><o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:13.5pt;background:white"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:#B20022">Find the Perfect Mix of Data and Narrative</span><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:black"><o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:11.25pt;line-height:16.5pt;background:white">  <span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:black">We all know that humans are wired to listen to stories, and metaphors abound for the narrative structures that work best to engage people. When I think about compelling presentations,   I think about taking an audience on a journey. A successful talk is a little miracle&#8212;people see the world differently afterward.</span><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:black"><o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:11.25pt;line-height:16.5pt;background:white">  <span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:black">If you frame the talk as a journey, the biggest decisions are figuring out where to start and where to end. To find the right place to start, consider what people in the audience   already know about your subject&#8212;and how much they care about it. If you assume they have more knowledge or interest than they do, or if you start using jargon or get too technical, you&#8217;ll lose them. The most engaging speakers do a superb job of very quickly   introducing the topic, explaining why they care so deeply about it, and convincing the audience members that they should, too.</span><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:black"><o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:9.0pt;font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:#585556;background:white">by Chris Anderson,<span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>the curator of TED<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:9.0pt;font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:#585556;background:white">From:  </span><a href="http://hbr.org/2013/06/how-to-give-a-killer-presentation/ar/1">http://hbr.org/2013/06/how-to-give-a-killer-presentation/ar/1</a><o:p></o:p></p>  </div>  </div>
