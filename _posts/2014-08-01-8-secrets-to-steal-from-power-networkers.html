  <div><div class="WordSection1">  <p style="line-height:18.0pt;vertical-align:baseline"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;ff-meta-serif-web-pro&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;color:#222222">You've no doubt heard it a million times: Career advancement is as much about who you know as what you know &#8212; and   that's exactly why being a powerful networker is so important.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p style="line-height:18.0pt;vertical-align:baseline"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;ff-meta-serif-web-pro&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;color:#222222">But mastering this crucial skill requires more than just schmoozing over cheese platters and exchanging business cards.   There's actually an art to it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p style="line-height:18.0pt;vertical-align:baseline"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;ff-meta-serif-web-pro&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;color:#222222">&quot;Since there are so many different platforms for people to market themselves these days, you have to find ways to   cut through the white noise and get noticed,&quot; says Ivan Misner, Ph.D., author of Networking Like a Pro.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p style="line-height:18.0pt;vertical-align:baseline"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;ff-meta-serif-web-pro&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;color:#222222">When done skillfully, networking can not only open the door to plum job opportunities but it can also help land new   clients and tap talent for future hiring. And what better way to learn the ins and outs of such skillful networking than to go straight to power networking pros for their tips on how to land on someone's radar &#8212; and stay there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p style="line-height:18.0pt;vertical-align:baseline"><b><span style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;ff-meta-serif-web-pro&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;color:#222222">Power tip #1: Give before you receive<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>  <p style="line-height:18.0pt;vertical-align:baseline"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;ff-meta-serif-web-pro&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;color:#222222">One of the biggest networking mistakes people make is jumping the gun when asking for a favor. One cardinal key of   successful networking: Give before you can get.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p style="line-height:18.0pt;vertical-align:baseline"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;ff-meta-serif-web-pro&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;color:#222222">&quot;I can't emphasize this enough &#8212; if you want to form a relationship with another person, you first need to show them   how they'll benefit,&quot; says professional relationship development expert Keith Ferrazzi, author of Never Eat Alone: And Other Secrets to Success, One Relationship at a Time. &quot;You usually bring a small gift to a dinner party, so why wouldn't you offer a potential   ally a token of generosity when you meet?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p style="line-height:18.0pt;vertical-align:baseline"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;ff-meta-serif-web-pro&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;color:#222222">And according to Ferrazzi, it needn't be elaborate either. The gesture can be as simple as forwarding a relevant article   or providing an introduction to someone who can further the person's own interests.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p style="line-height:18.0pt;vertical-align:baseline"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;ff-meta-serif-web-pro&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;color:#222222">So when can you comfortably turn the tables and ask for help? It's a judgment call. But seeking favors too early can   turn your contacts off &#8212; and risk damaging any positive collateral you've stored up. &quot;People often say, 'Hey, it doesn't hurt to ask, right?'&quot; Misner says. &quot;But if you ask before you've established a relationship, then you are destroying the opportunity to   cultivate one.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p style="line-height:18.0pt;vertical-align:baseline"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;ff-meta-serif-web-pro&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;color:#222222">So think of networking like a bank account &#8212; you have to make deposits and shore up social capital before making a   withdrawal. Case in point: One of Misner's contacts called him up every month or two to ask how his latest project was going and whether he could pitch in. After reaching out several times over a year, he told Misner he had a favor to ask. &quot;I replied, 'Yes!'   &quot; Misner says. &quot;He hadn't even told me what he needed, but he'd invested so much in our relationship that I was happy to do it.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p style="line-height:18.0pt;vertical-align:baseline"><b><span style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;ff-meta-serif-web-pro&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;color:#222222">Power tip #2: Ask for a strategic introduction<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>  <p style="line-height:18.0pt;vertical-align:baseline"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;ff-meta-serif-web-pro&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;color:#222222">If there's a specific person you're hoping to connect with, do some Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn sleuthing to see   if you have a contact who knows that individual directly, or at least knows someone who works for the same organization.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p style="line-height:18.0pt;vertical-align:baseline"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;ff-meta-serif-web-pro&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;color:#222222">Explain your game plan to your contact &#8212; you're a huge fan of the company and would love to build a strategic relationship   with such-and-such key player &#8212; and then ask if the person might be able to introduce you at an upcoming networking event.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p style="line-height:18.0pt;vertical-align:baseline"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;ff-meta-serif-web-pro&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;color:#222222">&quot;If you can find it, a third-party endorsement will give you a powerful edge,&quot; Misner says. &quot;It makes you stand out,   and lends you credibility.&quot; And the more credibility you have, the more likely that person will trust that you're worth his time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p style="line-height:18.0pt;vertical-align:baseline"><b><span style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;ff-meta-serif-web-pro&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;color:#222222">Power tip #3: Don't just collect cards<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>  <p style="line-height:18.0pt;vertical-align:baseline"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;ff-meta-serif-web-pro&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;color:#222222">In the game of networking, you're going for quality, not quantity &#8212; so simply focusing on beefing up your Rolodex   will backfire.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p style="line-height:18.0pt;vertical-align:baseline"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;ff-meta-serif-web-pro&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;color:#222222">Misner recalls meeting a young woman who claimed to be a pro networker. Her &quot;brilliant&quot; technique? She and her business   partner would split the room in half, amassing as many business cards as possible. They'd then enter all the info into a database and email their new contacts. &quot;Essentially, they'd spam people,&quot; Misner says. &quot;Using networking like a face-to-face cold-calling   opportunity is a huge error.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p style="line-height:18.0pt;vertical-align:baseline"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;ff-meta-serif-web-pro&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;color:#222222">Instead of casting a wide net, direct it toward cultivating deep personal connections. &quot;People are always chasing   bright, shiny objects, but I'm a firm believer in doing six things a thousand times, not a thousand things six times,&quot; Misner says.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p style="line-height:18.0pt;vertical-align:baseline"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;ff-meta-serif-web-pro&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;color:#222222">To do this, Ferrazzi recommends creating a relationship action plan for every professional goal that you have &#8212; be   it landing a new job or building up your client base. Make a list of people who can be instrumental in helping you achieve that success: friends, co-workers, people you're hoping to meet, and even individuals you admire and just follow online.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p style="line-height:18.0pt;vertical-align:baseline"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;ff-meta-serif-web-pro&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;color:#222222">&quot;Write down why each person is important, and how you would categorize the strength of your relationship on a scale   of zero to five,&quot; he says. This will help you develop a strategy to pursue your goals &#8212; and home in on getting help from the right people.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p style="line-height:18.0pt;vertical-align:baseline"><b><span style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;ff-meta-serif-web-pro&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;color:#222222">Power tip #4: Follow up &#8212; and then follow up again<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>  <p style="line-height:18.0pt;vertical-align:baseline"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;ff-meta-serif-web-pro&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;color:#222222">After clicking with a powerful new connection, too many people drop the ball &#8212; failing to check in post-meeting and   never leveraging the new relationship.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p style="line-height:18.0pt;vertical-align:baseline"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;ff-meta-serif-web-pro&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;color:#222222">So try this strategy from Kim Marie Branch-Pettid, C.E.O. and president of LeTip International, a business networking   and referral organization. Immediately following a conversation with a person of interest, Branch jots down a number from one to 10 on the back of their business card, indicating their potential to help her advance in her career. For anyone who scores a seven   or above, she adds a brief note about them, such as &quot;trip to London, 3-year-old son, starting a new job.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p style="line-height:18.0pt;vertical-align:baseline"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;ff-meta-serif-web-pro&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;color:#222222">The next day, Branch sends an email to the person, saying that she enjoyed the conversation, and references one of   her notes, like &quot;Have a great time in London!&quot; Finally, she assists in some way, by sending a link to an interesting London travel article or offering to introduce the person to a friend who works at the same company they just joined.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p style="line-height:18.0pt;vertical-align:baseline"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;ff-meta-serif-web-pro&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;color:#222222">And don't forget to maintain the connection. &quot;In order for your relationships to become more robust, you need to 'ping'   your network on a regular basis,&quot; Ferrazzi says. &quot;Create a schedule for keeping in touch, whether you set aside X amount of time each day to networking, or reach out to X number of people each week.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p style="line-height:18.0pt;vertical-align:baseline"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;ff-meta-serif-web-pro&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;color:#222222">The frequency and depth of your interactions depends on the strength of the relationship. For casual connections,   the occasional retweet or Facebook comment might suffice. For deeper ones, think along the lines of a thoughtful email or meetup.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p style="line-height:18.0pt;vertical-align:baseline"><b><span style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;ff-meta-serif-web-pro&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;color:#222222">Power tip #5: Suss out your contact's passions<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>  <p style="line-height:18.0pt;vertical-align:baseline"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;ff-meta-serif-web-pro&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;color:#222222">Before meeting someone you'd like to develop a relationship with, do an online search to uncover what they're truly   interested in, from charities they support to any awards they've received.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p style="line-height:18.0pt;vertical-align:baseline"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;ff-meta-serif-web-pro&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;color:#222222">&quot;Doing your homework shows a sincere interest in the other person as an individual, and not just as a business contact,&quot;   Ferrazzi says. &quot;It also helps you understand how you can be of service &#8212; if you can offer something specifically geared to what's important to them, they'll be more open to connecting with you.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p style="line-height:18.0pt;vertical-align:baseline"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;ff-meta-serif-web-pro&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;color:#222222">Misner used this technique to land a coveted interview with Virgin mogul Richard Branson. After learning that Branson   had recently launched a nonprofit called the B-Team, Misner used the nugget as his &quot;in.&quot; During a run-in with Branson, whom he'd met once before, he said, &quot;I understand you're doing something called the B-Team. Tell me about it.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p style="line-height:18.0pt;vertical-align:baseline"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;ff-meta-serif-web-pro&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;color:#222222">&quot;He lit up,&quot; Misner remembers. &quot;I asked him how I could be of help with the project, and suggested interviewing him   for my blog.&quot; It was a win-win networking move: Branson's charity got some extra airplay, while Misner landed his interview.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p style="line-height:18.0pt;vertical-align:baseline"><b><span style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;ff-meta-serif-web-pro&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;color:#222222">Power tip #6: Deepen your network pool<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>  <p style="line-height:18.0pt;vertical-align:baseline"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;ff-meta-serif-web-pro&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;color:#222222">The more similar someone is to you, the more comfortable it feels to connect, which is why networks are, by nature,   homogenous. &quot;We tend to hang out with people like ourselves &#8212; the same gender, ethnicity, and academic background,&quot; Misner says. &quot;But diversity is key to growing a strong personal network.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p style="line-height:18.0pt;vertical-align:baseline"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;ff-meta-serif-web-pro&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;color:#222222">So seek relationships with totally different people who can introduce you to brand-new social clusters. Not only will   you gain access to potentially influential individuals whom you'd otherwise might never meet, but you'll stand out from the pack.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p style="line-height:18.0pt;vertical-align:baseline"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;ff-meta-serif-web-pro&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;color:#222222">For example, Misner is a member of an organization of women business owners. They allow men to join, so he asked a   female friend to sponsor him at a meeting. &quot;Everyone remembered me because I was one of two or three guys there,&quot; Misner says. &quot;I ended up getting a lot of business out of it.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p style="line-height:18.0pt;vertical-align:baseline"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;ff-meta-serif-web-pro&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;color:#222222">One important way to diversify is to &quot;network down.&quot; Most people concentrate on networking up&#8212; building a rapport   with someone higher than yourself on the ladder. But it's also smart to connect with savvy junior people in your industry because they might end up being portals of intel that can boost your career down the line.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p style="line-height:18.0pt;vertical-align:baseline"><b><span style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;ff-meta-serif-web-pro&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;color:#222222">Power tip #7: Don't overly pimp your profile<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>  <p style="line-height:18.0pt;vertical-align:baseline"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;ff-meta-serif-web-pro&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;color:#222222">If your LinkedIn page is open like a 7-Eleven, and you're accepting invites from everyone and their mother, you could   be putting your reputation on the line.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p style="line-height:18.0pt;vertical-align:baseline"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;ff-meta-serif-web-pro&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;color:#222222">Your LinkedIn contacts are a reflection on you, and it's implied that you're vouching for someone's skills by connecting.   So just like you wouldn't give any Joe Schmo a job reference, you also shouldn't add contact requests from complete strangers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p style="line-height:18.0pt;vertical-align:baseline"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;ff-meta-serif-web-pro&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;color:#222222">Likewise, &quot;You should only reach out to someone via LinkedIn if you have a connection in common,&quot; Branch says, adding   that you should write a message when asking to connect, rather than using LinkedIn's form letter. And if you don't have any shared connections, it's better to get in touch via a more personal email or letter.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p style="line-height:18.0pt;vertical-align:baseline"><b><span style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;ff-meta-serif-web-pro&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;color:#222222">Power tip #8: Seek common ground<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>  <p style="line-height:18.0pt;vertical-align:baseline"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;ff-meta-serif-web-pro&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;color:#222222">There is a shortcut to fostering a new relationship with real roots: Figure out what you and the other person have   in common &#8212; whether you went to the same school or both love to snowboard.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p style="line-height:18.0pt;vertical-align:baseline"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;ff-meta-serif-web-pro&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;color:#222222">&quot;Focusing on the similarities between you is a quick way to develop a rapport,&quot; Branch says. &quot;So don't be afraid to   ask personal questions that let the individual speak about him or herself: Where are you from? Do you have kids?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p style="margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:18.0pt;vertical-align:baseline">  <span style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;ff-meta-serif-web-pro&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;color:#222222">Then it's your turn to open up. One of Branch's associates made several powerful connections after mentioning that she had been jumping out of airplanes since she was 14.   People who have skydived (or are interested in trying) are instantly drawn to her &#8212; it's like a built-in launching pad for cultivating a strong relationship.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p style="margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:18.0pt;vertical-align:baseline">  <span style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;ff-meta-serif-web-pro&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;color:#222222"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>  <p style="margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:18.0pt;vertical-align:baseline">  <em><span style="font-family:&quot;ff-meta-serif-web-pro&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;color:#222222;border:none windowtext 1.0pt;padding:0in">This story was originally published on</span></em><span class="apple-converted-space"><i><span style="font-family:&quot;ff-meta-serif-web-pro&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;color:#222222;border:none windowtext 1.0pt;padding:0in">&nbsp;</span></i></span><em><span style="font-family:&quot;ff-meta-serif-web-pro&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;color:#222222;border:none windowtext 1.0pt;padding:0in"><a href="http://www.learnvest.com/2014/07/networking-secrets/" target="_blank"><span style="color:#222222;text-decoration:none">LearnVest</span></a>.
