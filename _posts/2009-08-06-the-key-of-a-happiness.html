  <div><DIV><FONT size=2>  <P>We've always been told it's true, but now experts have proved that money   really can't buy you happiness.</P>  <P>They quizzed jackpot winners and came up with 10 tips to keep you feeling on   top of the world.</P>  <P>And the results were surprising. No flash cars of expensive jewellery.   Instead it was the simple pleasures, available to almost anybody, that bring the   most enjoyment.</P>  <P>Top of the list is spending time with your family.</P>  <P>But jackpot winners' advice is: "Don't give up work. Having a regular routine   and social interaction are essential. Keeping up friendships is important too,   as is a stable marriage.</P>  <P>Buying your own home, preferably in the North where people are friendlier, is   a good idea. But don't get into debt.</P>  <P>No matter how much money you have, living within your means is vital if you   want to avoid stress."</P>  <P>Dr Richard Tunney, of Nottingham University said: "The old saying 'money   can't buy you happiness' may not be true, but traditional family values, a   comfortable home and financial security are clearly key elements to a happy   life."</P></FONT></DIV></div>
