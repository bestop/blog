  <div class="post"><h2>{{ page.title }}</h2><strong>{{ page.date | date_to_long_string }}</strong><div><DIV><FONT size=2>  <P   style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px; TEXT-INDENT: -1.5pt">奥巴马在即将上任之际，写了封公开信给两个尚未成年的女儿。</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px; TEXT-INDENT: -1.5pt">亲爱的玛丽亚和萨莎：</P>  <P   style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px; TEXT-INDENT: -1.5pt">这些是我想要让你们得到的东西：在一个梦想不受限制、无事不能成就的世界中长大，长成具慈悲心、坚持理想，能帮忙打造这样一个世界的女性。我要每个孩子都有和你们一样的机会，去学习、梦想、成长、发展。这就是我带领我们一家开始这趟大冒险的原因。我深以你俩为荣，你们永远不会明白我有多爱你们，在我们准备一同在白宫开始新生活之际，我没有一天不为你们的忍耐、沉稳、明理和幽默而心存感激。</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px; TEXT-INDENT: -1.5pt">Dear Malia and Sasha,</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px; TEXT-INDENT: -1.5pt">I know that you've both had   a lot of fun these last two years on the campaign trail, going to picnics and   parades and state fairs, eating all sorts of junk food your mother and I   probably shouldn't have let you have. But I also know that it hasn't always been   easy for you and Mom, and that as excited as you both are about that new puppy,   it doesn't make up for all the time we've been apart. I know how much I've   missed these past two years, and today I want to tell you a little more about   why I decided to take our family on this journey.</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px; TEXT-INDENT: -1.5pt">When I was a young man, I   thought life was all about me-about how I'd make my way in the world, become   successful, and get the things I want. But then the two of you came into my   world with all your curiosity and mischief and those smiles that never fail to   fill my heart and light up my day. And suddenly, all my big plans for myself   didn't seem so important anymore. I soon found that the greatest joy in my life   was the joy I saw in yours. And I realized that my own life wouldn't count for   much unless I was able to ensure that you had every opportunity for happiness   and fulfillment in yours. In the end, girls, that's why I ran for President:   because of what I want for you and for every child in this nation.</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px; TEXT-INDENT: -1.5pt">I want all our children to   go to schools worthy of their potential-schools that challenge them, inspire   them, and instill in them a sense of wonder about the world around them. I want   them to have the chance to go to college-even if their parents aren't rich. And   I want them to get good jobs: jobs that pay well and give them benefits like   health care, jobs that let them spend time with their own kids and retire with   dignity.</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px; TEXT-INDENT: -1.5pt">I want us to push the   boundaries of discovery so that you'll live to see new technologies and   inventions that improve our lives and make our planet cleaner and safer. And I   want us to push our own human boundaries to reach beyond the divides of race and   region, gender and religion that keep us from seeing the best in each other.</P>  <P align=right><IMG id=1288575 title=""   style="BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 0px solid; BORDER-TOP: #000000 0px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 0px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 0px solid"   height=248 alt="What I want for you 奥巴马给女儿的信"   src="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/language_tips/book/attachement/jpg/site1/20090416/0013729e41a90b5111b118.jpg"   width=202 align=right border=0 zmxid="zoomXimageId6" md5=""   sourcedescription="编辑提供的本地文件" sourcename="本地文件"></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px; TEXT-INDENT: -1.5pt">Sometimes we have to send   our young men and women into war and other dangerous situations to protect our   country-but when we do, I want to make sure that it is only for a very good   reason, that we try our best to settle our differences with others peacefully,   and that we do everything possible to keep our servicemen and women safe. And I   want every child to understand that the blessings these brave Americans fight   for are not free-that with the great privilege of being a citizen of this nation   comes great responsibility.</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px; TEXT-INDENT: -1.5pt">That was the lesson your   grandmother tried to teach me when I was your age, reading me the opening lines   of the Declaration of Independence and telling me about the men and women who   marched for equality because they believed those words put to paper two   centuries ago should mean something.</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px; TEXT-INDENT: -1.5pt">She helped me understand   that America is great not because it is perfect but because it can always be   made better-and that the unfinished work of perfecting our union falls to each   of us. It's a charge we pass on to our children, coming closer with each new   generation to what we know America should be.</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px; TEXT-INDENT: -1.5pt">I hope both of you will   take up that work, righting the wrongs that you see and working to give others   the chances you've had. Not just because you have an obligation to give   something back to this country that has given our family so much-although you do   have that obligation. But because you have an obligation to yourself. Because it   is only when you hitch your wagon to something larger than yourself that you   will realize your true potential.</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px; TEXT-INDENT: -1.5pt">These are the things I want   for you-to grow up in a world with no limits on your dreams and no achievements   beyond your reach, and to grow into compassionate, committed women who will help   build that world. And I want every child to have the same chances to learn and   dream and grow and thrive that you girls have. That's why I've taken our family   on this great adventure.</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px; TEXT-INDENT: -1.5pt">I am so proud of both of   you. I love you more than you can ever know. And I am grateful every day for   your patience, poise, grace, and humor as we prepare to start our new life   together in the White House.</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px; TEXT-INDENT: -1.5pt">Love,   Dad</P></FONT></DIV></div>
