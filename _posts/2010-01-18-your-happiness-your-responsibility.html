  <div><DIV><FONT face=Arial>"You are the only one who can make you happy." We have all   heard that so many times in our lives. <BR><BR>There are times it is a pretty   tough pill to swallow. In reality, the people that surround you have a huge   impact on your current mood. When your children are grumpy in the morning, you   find a nice pile the dog left you over night, you hit the road and the traffic   won't allow you your normal speed, then when you get to work and your co-worker   called in sick... these are all things that might contribute to your overall   Happiness of the day. <BR><BR>However, moods and temporary emotions are not the   same as happiness. Happiness exists when you look at the overall picture of your   life and you smile, that is happiness. You know those times when you can't wait   for your children to go to bed, then later you check on the kids and you almost   cry because they look exactly like angels... YOUR ANGELS, sleeping so sweetly   and soundly. You can hardly remember a time of irritation with them. That is   Happiness. <BR><BR>As life progresses and changes, we realize that who we are,   (what makes us, us)... that is what we are responsible for. We know that   immediate gratification or irritation only pacifies or deteriorates our   emotional stimuli short term. Our global view of how we see ourselves determines   our state of mind. Our state of mind determines our Happiness. <BR><BR>So, how   do we take control of our emotions and find the path of Happiness? This seems to   be the million dollar question. There are tons of books on or related to the   subject. You could read and practice until you are completely confused. Or, we   could spend the rest of our life introspectively evaluating what makes us happy.   Which might take more time and energy and actually frustrate us more.   <BR><BR>How about this? What if we looked at ourselves and decided what we liked   and didn't like and set about making changes. It doesn't have to be major   alterations. Maybe you are tired of your house but can't afford to move. Try   painting the living room or buying flowers to set on the kitchen table. If you   haven't had a vacation for awhile and just can't afford to take that cruise, go   camping instead. <BR><BR>Maybe the issues are more personal or internal. Do you   get mad too easily? Learn yoga or meditation. Are you having marital problems?   Visit a counselor. Are the kids having discipline issues? Determine the major   issues, establish guidelines on how you are going to correct the problem and   stick to it. <BR><BR>You may be saying, 'Sure, that sounds so easy but...' Of   course it sounds easy. Problems are always easier to talk about than to take the   obvious actions to fix them. But, for the most part, things are as difficult or   as easy as we determine them to be. Sometimes we just make things harder than   necessary. <BR><BR>If your unHappiness stems from a situation beyond your   control then find other ways to compensate. If, for example, money is so tight   and no apparent windfall is coming your way any time soon, find inexpensive   entertainment. Backyard ballgames, picnics in the park, movie night with popcorn   and snacks in your bedroom are a few alternatives to an expensive night out. If   the issues are more serious and you feel powerless, that is the time to seek   professional help. <BR><BR>Otherwise, look in the mirror and be glad. If you   don't like what you see, change it. Make the solution that   simple!</FONT></DIV></div>
