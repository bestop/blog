  <div><p><span style="font-family:arial;">A certain daughter complained to her father about her life and how things have been so hard for her. She did not know how she was going to make it and she wanted to give up. She was tired of fighting and struggling. It seemed that just as one problem was solved another arose.</span></p><br /><p><span style="font-family:arial;">Her father, a chef, took her to the kitchen, filled three pots with water and placed the fire on high. Soon the three pots came to a boil. In one he placed carrots, in the other he placed eggs, and the last he placed ground coffee beans. He let them sit and boil, without saying a word.</span></p><br /><p align="left"><span style="font-family:arial;"><img style="WIDTH: 183px; HEIGHT: 275px" id="3728895" title="" border="0" alt="生活感悟：胡萝卜、鸡蛋和咖啡豆" align="right" src="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/language_tips/att/site1/20110421/0023ae731d750f1a126e4f.jpeg" sourcename="本地文件" sourcedescription="编辑提供的本地文件" md5="" /></span></p><br /><p><span style="font-family:arial;">The daughter sucked her teeth and impatiently wondered what he was trying to do. She had problems, and he was making this strange concoction. In half an hour he walked over to the stove and turned down the fire. He pulled the carrots out and placed them in the bowl. He pulled the eggs out and placed them in the bowl. Then he ladled the coffee out and placed it in a bowl. Turning to her he asked. "Darling what do you see?"</span></p><br /><p><span style="font-family:arial;">"Carrots, eggs, and coffee." she replied.</span></p><br /><p><span style="font-family:arial;">He brought her closer and asked her to feel the carrots. She did and noted that they were soft. He then asked her to take an egg and break it. After pulling off the shell, she observed the hard-boiled egg. Finally, he asked her to sip the coffee. Her face frowned from the strength of the coffee.</span></p><br /><p><span style="font-family:arial;">Humbly, she asked. "What does it mean Father?"</span></p><br /><p><span style="font-family:arial;">He explained. "Each of them faced the same adversity, 212 degrees of boiling water. However each reacted differently. The carrot went in strong, hard, and unrelenting. But after going through boiling water, it softened and became weak. The egg was fragile. A thin outer shell protected a liquid center. But after sitting through the boiling water, it's inside became hardened. The coffee beans are unique however. After they were in the boiling water, it became stronger and richer."</span></p><br /><p><span style="font-family:arial;">"Which are you," he asked his daughter, "When adversity knocks on your door, how do you respond? Are you a carrot, an egg, or a coffee bean?"</span></p></div>
