He was hungry so he decided to beg for a meal at               the next house.</DIV>              <DIV class=3jineiwen>              <P>However, he lost his nerve when a lovely young woman opened the               door. Instead of a meal he asked for a drink of water. She thought               he looked hungry so she brought him a large glass of milk. He drank               it slowly, and then asked, "How much do I owe you?"</P>              <P>"You don't owe me anything," she replied. "Mother has taught me               never to accept pay for a kindness." He said, "Then I thank you from               the bottom of my heart." As Howard Kelly left that house, he not               only felt stronger physically, but it also increased his faith in               God and the human race. He was about to give up and quit before this               point.</P>              <P>Years later the young woman became critically ill. The local               doctors were baffled. They finally sent her to the big city, where               specialists can be called in to study her rare disease. Dr. Howard               Kelly, now famous was called in for the consultation. When he heard               the name of the town she came from, a strange light filled his eyes.               Immediately, he rose and went down through the hospital hall into               her room.</P>              <P>Dressed in his doctor's gown he went in to see her. He recognized               her at once. He went back to the consultation room and determined to               do his best to save her life. From that day on, he gave special               attention to her case.<BR><BR>After a long struggle, the battle was               won. Dr. Kelly requested the business office to pass the final bill               to him for approval. He looked at it and then wrote something on the               side. The bill was sent to her room. She was afraid to open it               because she was positive that it would take the rest of her life to               pay it off. Finally she looked, and the note on the side of the bill               caught her attention. She read these words...</P>              <P>"Paid in full with a glass of milk."<BR>(Signed) Dr. Howard               Kelly</P>              <P>Tears of joy flooded her eyes as she prayed silently: "Thank You,               God. Your love has spread through human hearts and               hands."<BR></P></DIV></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>  <DIV><FONT size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV></div>
