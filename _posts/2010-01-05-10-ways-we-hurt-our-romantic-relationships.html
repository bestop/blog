We get in our own way with ideas and attitudes about   relationships that are not only wrong, but often work to undermine our   relationships no matter how hard we work at it.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>I've watched a lot of breakups   (some of them my own). I've seen dramatic flare-ups and drawn-out slow fades,   and I've tried to pay attention to what seems to be going on. Here are a few of   the things I've seen that cause people to destroy their own   relationships.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>1. You're playing to   win</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>One of the deadliest killers of   relationships is the competitive urge. I don't mean competition in the sense   that you can't stand to lose at tennis, I mean the attitude that the   relationship itself is a kind of game that you're tying to win. People in   competitive relationships are always looking for an advantage, the upper hand,   some edge they can hold over their partner's head. If you feel that there are   things you can't tell your partner because she or he will use it against you,   you're in a competitive relationship ― but not for long.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>2. You don't trust</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>There are two aspects of trust   that are important in relationships. One is trusting your partner enough to know   that s/he won't cheat on you or otherwise hurt you ― and to know that he or she   trusts you that way, too. The other is trusting them enough to know they won't   leave you or stop loving you no matter what you do or say. The second that level   of trust is gone, whether because one of you takes advantage of that trust and   does something horrible or because one of you thinks the other has, the   relationship is over ― even if it takes 10 more years for you to break   up.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>3. You don't talk</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Too many people hold their   tongues about things that bother or upset them in their relationship, either   because they don't want to hurt their partner, or because they're trying to win.   (See #1 above; example: "If you don't know why I'm mad, I'm certainly not going   to tell you!") While this might make things easier in the short term, in the   long run it gradually erodes the foundation of the relationship away. Little   issues grow into bigger and bigger problems ― problems that don't get fixed   because your partner is blissfully unaware, or worse, is totally aware of them   but thinks they don't really bother you. Ultimately, keeping quiet reflects a   lack of trust ― and, as I said that's the death of a relationship.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>4. You don't listen</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Listening ― really listening ―   is hard. It's normal to want to defend ourselves when we hear something that   seems like criticism, so instead of really hearing someone out, we interrupt to   explain or excuse ourselves, or we turn inward to prepare our defense. But your   partner deserves your active listening. S/he even deserves you to hear the   between-the-lines content of daily chit-chat, to suss out his/her dreams and   desires when even s/he doesn't even know exactly what they are. If you can't   listen that way, at least to the person you love, there's a problem.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>5. You spend like a single   person</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>This was a hard lesson for me   to learn ― until it broke up a 7-year relationship. When you're single, you can   buy whatever you want, whenever you want, with little regard for the future.   It's not necessarily wise, but you're the only one who has to pay the   consequences. When you are with someone in a long-term relationship, that is no   longer a possibility. Your partner ― and your children, if there are or will be   any ― will have to bear the brunt of your spending, so you'd better get in the   habit of taking care of household necessities first and then, if there's   anything left over, of discussing with your partner the best way to use   it.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>This is an increasing problem   these days, because more and more people are opting to keep their finances   separate, even when they're married. There's nothing wrong with that kind of   arrangement in and of itself, but it demands more communication and involvement   between the partners, not less. If you're spending money as if it was your money   and nobody else has a right to tell you what to do with it, your relationship is   doomed.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>6. You're afraid of breaking   up</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Nobody in a truly happy   partnership is afraid of breaking up. If you are, that's a big warning sign that   something's wrong. But often, what's wrong is the fear itself. Not only does it   betray a lack of trust, but it shows a lack of self-confidence and self-esteem ―   you're afraid that there's no good reason for someone to want to be with you,   and that sooner or later your partner will "wise up" and take off. So you pour   more energy into keeping up the appearance of a happy relationships than you do   into building yourself up as a person. Quite frankly, this isn't going to be   very satisfying for you, and it also isn't going to be very satisfying for your   partner.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>7. You're dependent</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>There's a thin line between   companionship and support and dependency. If you depend on your partner ― that   is, if you absolutely cannot live without her or him ― you've crossed that line.   The pressure is now on your partner to fill whatever's missing in you ― a   pressure s/he will learn to resent. If you expect your partner to bring   everything while you bring nothing to your relationship ― and I'm talking   finances as well as emotional support, here ― you're in trouble. (Note: I'm not   saying that you need to contribute equally to household finances ― what I'm   saying is that if you're not contributing to the household budget, and you're   not contributing anywhere else, things are out of whack and that's never   good.)</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>8. You expect   Happiness</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>A sign of a bad relationship is   that one or both partners expect either to make the other happy or for their   partner to make them happy. This is not only an unrealistic expectation to lay   on yourself or on them ― nobody can "make" you happy, except you ― but it's an   unrealistic expectation to lay on your relationship. Relationships aren't only   about being happy, and there's lots of times when you won't and even shouldn't   be. Being able to rely on someone even when you're upset, miserable, depressed,   or grieving is a lot more important than being happy all the time. If you expect   your partner to make you happy ― or worse, you're frustrated because you aren't   able to make your partner happy ― your relationship isn't going to fare well   when it hits a rough spot.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>9. You never fight</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>A good argument is essential,   every now and then. In part, arguing helps bring out the little stuff before it   becomes major, but also, fighting expresses anger which is a perfectly normal   part of a human's emotional make-up. Your relationship has to be strong enough   to hold all of who you are, not just the sunny stuff.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>One reason couples don't fight   is that they fear conflict ― which reflects a lack of trust and a foundation of   fear. That's bad. Another reason couples avoid arguments is that they've learned   that anger is unreasonable and unproductive. They've learned that arguing   represents a breakdown rather than a natural part of a relationship's   development. While an argument isn't pleasant, it can help both partners to   articulate issues they may not have even known they had ― and help keep them   from simmering until you cross a line you can't come back from.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>10. You expect it to be   easy/you expect it to be hard<BR><BR>There are two deeply problematic attitudes   about relationships I hear often. One is that a relationship should be easy,   that if you really love each other and are meant to be together, it will work   itself out. The other is that anything worth having is going to be hard ― and   that therefore if it's hard, it must be worth having.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>The outcome of both views is   that you don't work at your relationship. You don't work because it's supposed   to be easy and therefore not need any work, or you don't work because it's   supposed to be hard and it wouldn't be hard if you worked at it. In both cases,   you quickly get burnt out ― either because the problems you're ignoring really   don't go away just because you think they should. or because the problems you're   cultivating are a constant drag on your energy. A relationship that's too much   work might be suffering from one of the attitudes above, but a relationship that   doesn't seem to need any work isn't any better.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Your choices</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>There isn't any one answer to   any of the problems above. There are choices though: you can either seek out an   answer, something that addresses why you are hurting your relationship, or you   can resign yourself to the failure of your relationship (and maybe the next one,   and the next one, and…). Failure doesn't always mean you break up ― many people   aren't that lucky. But people can live quite unhappily in failed relationships   for years and even decades because they're afraid they won't find anything   better, or worse, they're afraid they deserve it. Don't you be one of them ― if   you suffer from any of these problems, figure out how to fix it, whether that   means therapy, a solo mountain retreat, or just talking to your partner and   committing yourselves to change.</FONT></P></DIV></DIV></div>
