Gritting my teeth, I turned on a flashlight, put on my shoes, unzipped   the door of my tent, stumbled out into the night, and made a dash for the   pit-toilet at the edge of the camp site.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>There was no   bear. But there were an impossibly large number of stars twinkling   above.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>I peed, ran   back to my tent, and half-slept till dawn.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Hours later,   as the sun crept up over the edge of the awesome Lassen peak � the jagged relic   of a powerful volcanic explosion that strewed boulders over hundreds of square   miles � in the remote northeast of California, I pulled my sleeping bag over my   head and whined exhaustedly that "everything has gone wrong."</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Like so many   other grouchy early morning, pre-coffee utterances I make, this one was   ludicrously off-key. Things weren't wrong; they were right.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>My wife and I   were in one tent with our two young kids; our friends Jessica and Michael, and   their two children, were in another. A hundred yards away was Summit Lake, the   glorious early morning mists shimmering off the water. A couple miles to the   south-west was the base of the Lassen Peak Trail. The base was 8,000ft above sea   level, huge snowbanks dotting the landscape even in mid August. The peak of the   volcano soared 2,500ft above, its ragged tree line halfway up, marking the outer   limits of ecological regeneration following a series of hundreds of "minor"   eruptions in the early 20th century that were immortalised in the photographs of   BF Loomis.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Above, lay a   rocky, craggy moonscape. Further west still was Bumpass Hell, an inferno of   bubbling, sulphurous mud and water, with plumes of steam rising up through the   delicate crust surrounding the cauldrons.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>We fired up   the camp stove, got out our cold boxes from the heavy metal bear-locker, fried   up some bacon, cut open some bagels, and boiled up a thermos-full of   coffee.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Half an hour   later, my six-year-old daughter and I were in the parking lot of the Lassen peak   trail, getting ready to hike as far as we could up the mountainside. We wouldn't   make it all the way � young legs get pretty tired on a steep mountain trail in   the thin air two miles above sea level � but it didn't matter. We would see   nature at its extremes: grand vistas spread out below us, the volcanic ash that   layered on the earth turning the melting snows an eerie pink as the sun struck   it; the blues of the sky shading into the blues of distant lakes, which in turn   shaded into the whites and pinks and grays of the snowpack.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>My daughter   grabbed my camera. She wanted to take a photo of "the composite" of colours.   Looking out over that landscape, and seeing my daughter grappling with the   immensity of nature, I felt stupid about my morning tirade.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Yes, camping   is uncomfortable. And yes, there's a lot to be said for getting out a credit   card, reserving a room in a nice hotel with a large TV in front of which to park   the kids, and going out for a fancy meal and a good glass of wine. But there's   also something infinitely wonderful about being so close to raw nature. And, as   important, there's something vital about getting young children out of their   increasingly technology-padded comfort zones and forcing them to encounter the   non-cyber world around them.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>We lose   something when we spend all our time cocooned inside a carefully constructed   modernity, when we read about daily affronts to the environment � yet, removed   from the majesty of nature, don't fully realise what is at stake. It's a good   thing to reconnect every so often with the Great Outdoors.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Lassen has no   hotels. If you want to see the splendours of this landscape, you have no choice   but to stay in one of the campsites nestling on the edge of the lakes and   against the sides of the mountains.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>After camping   in Yosemite, Teddy Roosevelt once declared that "It was like lying in a great   solemn cathedral, far vaster and more beautiful than any built by the hand of   man." That sentiment holds as true today as it did in Roosevelt's time. What a   wondrous thing is nature. And what a joy to see a child grasp that simple   truth.</FONT></P></DIV></DIV></div>
