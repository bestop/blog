  <div><DIV><FONT face=Arial>My grandparents were married for over half a century, and   played their own special game from the time they had met each other. The goal of   their game was to write the word "shmily" in a surprise place for the other to   find. They took turns leaving "shmily" around the house, and as soon as one of   them discovered it, it was their turn to hide it once more.</FONT></DIV>  <DIV><FONT face=Arial></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV><FONT face=Arial>They dragged "shmily" with their fingers through the sugar   and flour containers to await whoever was preparing the next meal. They smeared   it in the dew on the windows overlooking the patio where my grandma always fed   us warm, homemade pudding with blue food coloring. "Shmily" was written in the   steam left on the mirror after a hot shower, where it would reappear bath after   bath.</FONT></DIV>  <DIV><FONT face=Arial></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV><FONT face=Arial>At one point, my grandmother even unrolled an entire roll   of toilet paper to leave "shmily" on the very last sheet.</FONT></DIV>  <DIV><FONT face=Arial></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV><FONT face=Arial>There was no end to the places "shmily" would pop up.   Little notes with "shmily" scribbled hurriedly were found on dashboards and car   seats, or taped to steering wheels. The notes were stuffed inside shoes and left   under pillows.</FONT></DIV>  <DIV><FONT face=Arial></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV><FONT face=Arial>"Shmily" was written in the dust upon the mantel and   traced in the ashes of the fireplace. This mysterious word was as much a part of   my grandparents' house as the furniture.</FONT></DIV>  <DIV><FONT face=Arial></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV><FONT face=Arial>It took me a long time before I was able to fully   appreciate my grandparents' game. Skepticism has kept me from believing in true   love ― one that is pure and enduring. However, I never doubted my grandparents'   relationship. It was more than their flirtatious little games; it was a way of   life. Their relationship as based on a devotion and passionate affection which   not everyone is lucky enough to experience.</FONT></DIV>  <DIV><FONT face=Arial></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV><FONT face=Arial>Grandma and Grandpa held hands every chance they could.   They stole kisses as they bumped into each other in their tiny kitchen. They   finished each other's sentences and shared the daily crossword puzzle and word   jumble. My grandma whispered to me about how cute my grandpa was, how handsome   and old he had grown to be. Before every meal they bowed their heads and gave   thanks, marveling at their blessings: a wonderful family, good fortune, and each   other.</FONT></DIV>  <DIV><FONT face=Arial></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV><FONT face=Arial>But there was a dark cloud in my grandparents' life: my   grandmother had breast cancer. The disease had first appeared ten years earlier.   As always, Grandpa was with her every step of the way. He comforted her in their   yellow room, painted that way so that she could always be surrounded by   sunshine, even when she was too sick to go outside.</FONT></DIV>  <DIV><FONT face=Arial></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV><FONT face=Arial>Now the cancer was again attacking her body. With the help   of a cane and my grandfather's steady hand, they went to church every morning.   But my grandmother grew steadily weaker until, finally, she could not leave the   house anymore. For a while, Grandpa would go to church alone, praying to God to   watch over his wife.</FONT></DIV>  <DIV><FONT face=Arial></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV><FONT face=Arial>Then one day, what we all dreaded finally happened.   Grandma was gone.</FONT></DIV>  <DIV><FONT face=Arial></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV><FONT face=Arial>"Shmily." It was scrawled in yellow on the pink ribbons of   my grandmother's funeral bouquet. As the crowd thinned and the last mourners   turned to leave, my aunts, uncles, cousins and other family members came forward   and gathered around Grandma one last time. Grandpa stepped up to my   grand-mother's casket and, taking a shaky breath, he began to sing to her.   Through his tears and grief, the song came, a deep and throaty   lullaby.</FONT></DIV>  <DIV><FONT face=Arial></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV><FONT face=Arial>Shaking with my own sorrow, I will never forget that   moment. For I knew that, although I couldn't begin to fathom the depth of their   love, I had been privileged to witness its unmatched beauty. <BR>SHMILY: See how   much I love you.</FONT></DIV>  <DIV><FONT face=Arial></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV><FONT face=Arial></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV></div>
