  <div><DIV>  <DIV class=sanjineiwen>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>A peasant had a faithful horse   which had grown old and could do no more work, so his master no longer wanted to   give him anything to eat and said, "I can certainly make no more use of you, but   still I mean well by you, and if you prove yourself still strong enough to bring   me a lion here, I will maintain you. But for now get out of my stable." And with   that he chased him into the open field.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>The horse was sad, and went to   the forest to seek a little protection there from the weather. There the fox met   him and said, "Why do you hang your head so, and go about all alone?"</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"Alas," replied the horse,   "greed and loyalty do not dwell together in one house. My master has forgotten   what services I have performed for him for so many years, and because I can no   longer plow well, he will give me no more food, and has driven me   out."</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"Without giving you a chance?"   asked the fox.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"The chance was a bad one. He   said, if I were still strong enough to bring him a lion, he would keep me, but   he well knows that I cannot do that."</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>The fox said, "I will help you.   Just lie down, stretch out as if you were dead, and do not stir."</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>The horse did what the fox   asked, and then the fox went to the lion, who had his den not far off, and said,   "A dead horse is lying out there. Just come with me, and you can have a rich   meal."</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>The lion went with him, and   when they were both standing by the horse the fox said, "After all, it is not   very comfortable for you here&nbsp;- I tell you what -I will fasten it to you by   the tail, and then you can drag it into your cave and eat it in   peace."</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>This advice pleased the lion.   He positioned himself, and in order that the fox might tie the horse fast to   him, he kept completely quiet. But the fox tied the lion's legs together with   the horse's tail, and twisted and fastened everything so well and so strongly   that no amount of strength could pull it loose. When he had finished his work,   he tapped the horse on the shoulder and said, "Pull, white horse,   pull!"</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Then up sprang the horse at   once, and pulled the lion away with him. The lion began to roar so that all the   birds in the forest flew up in terror, but the horse let him roar, and drew him   and dragged him across the field to his master's door. When the master saw the   lion, he was of a better mind, and said to the horse, "You shall stay with me   and fare well." And he gave him plenty to eat until he   died.</FONT></P></DIV></DIV></div>
