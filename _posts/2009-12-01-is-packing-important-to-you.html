  <div class="post"><h2>{{ page.title }}</h2><strong>{{ page.date | date_to_long_string }}</strong><div><DIV>  <DIV class=3jbiaoti><FONT face=Arial>A young man was getting ready to graduate   from college. For many months he had admired a beautiful sports car in a   dealer's showroom, and knowing his father could well afford it, he told him that   was all he wanted.</FONT></DIV>  <DIV class=3jineiwen>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>As Graduation Day approached,   the young man awaited signs that his father had purchased the car. Finally, on   the morning of his graduation, his father called him into his private study. His   father told him how proud he was to have such a fine son, and told him how much   he loved him. He handed his son a beautiful wrapped gift box. Curious, but   somewhat disappointed, the young man opened the box and found a lovely,   leather-bound Bible, with the young man's name embossed in gold.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Angrily, he raised his voice to   his father and said, "With all your money you give me a Bible?" He then stormed   out of the house, leaving the Bible.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Many years passed and the young   man was very successful in business. He had a beautiful home and a wonderful   family, but realizing his father was very old, he thought perhaps he should go   to see him. He had not seen him since that graduation day. Before he could make   the arrangements, he received a telegram telling him his father had passed away,   and willed all of his possessions to his son. He needed to come home immediately   and take care of things.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>When he arrived at his father's   house, sudden sadness and regret filled his heart. He began to search through   his father's important papers and saw the still new Bible, just as he had left   it years ago.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>With tears, he opened the Bible   and began to turn the pages. As he was reading, a car key dropped from the back   of the Bible. It had a tag with the dealer's name, the same dealer who had the   sports car he had desired. On the tag was the date of his graduation, and the   words… "PAID IN FULL".</FONT></P>  <P align=center><FONT face=Arial></FONT></P>  <P align=right><FONT face=Arial><IMG style="WIDTH: 120px; HEIGHT: 90px"   id=655701 title="" border=0 align=right   src="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/language_tips/book/attachement/jpg/site1/20071205/0013729e42d208c0436106.jpg"   zmxid="zoomXimageId7" md5="" sourcedescription="编辑提供的本地文件"   sourcename="本地文件"></FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial></FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>How many times do we miss   blessings because they are not packaged as we expected? I trust you enjoyed   this. Do not spoil what you have by desiring what you have not; but remember   that what you now have was once among the things you only hoped for. Sometimes   we don't realize the good fortune we have or we could have because we expect   "the packaging" to be different. What may appear as bad fortune may in fact be   the door that is just waiting to be opened.</FONT></P></DIV></DIV></div>
