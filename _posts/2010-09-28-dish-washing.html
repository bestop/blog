  <div><DIV>  <DIV class=sanjineiwen>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>On Sundays my   father always wore that dull gray apron � the one with the race cars all over   it. The ritual began after breakfast when Dad always announced: "Go ahead   everyone. I'll take care of the dishes!" With that my mother disappeared into   the folds of the Sunday paper. Off came the suit coat he had worn to church that   morning. Up went the shirtsleeves. On went that apron. For the next hour Dad did   the dishes, singing ballads like "I Had a Hat When I Came In" and "Who Put the   Chow in Mrs. Murphy's Chowder?"</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>I suppose it   was strange for a boy's father to wear an apron � even one with race cars � but   I never thought much of it until the day that Dad broke with tradition. It was   the last Sunday in August. My father seemed in an expansive mood as we walked   home from church together.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"Tommy," he   said letting my name roll off his tongue. My mind raced ahead of his words: The   birds and the bees? A new bike? A part-time job?</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"There comes   a time in every boy's life when he must take on responsibilities." This was   important. I might even get to back the car out of the driveway.</FONT></P>  <P align=right><FONT face=Arial><IMG   style="BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 0px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 0px solid; BORDER-TOP: #000000 0px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 0px solid"   id=2276185 title="" border=0 alt="Dish washing 父亲让我洗盘子" align=right   src="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/language_tips/book/attachement/jpg/site1/20100310/0013729e41a90d018f7d2e.jpg"   width=282 height=319 sourcename="本地文件" sourcedescription="编辑提供的本地文件"   md5=""></FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT   face=Arial>"Responsibilities?" I asked.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"Yes. It's   time you took a greater role in the household." Power tools? Boss my baby   brother?</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"Starting   today, I want you to do the dishes on Sunday morning so your mother and I can   work the crossword puzzle together."</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"The   dishes!?"</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"Anything   wrong with taking over the dishes, son?"</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>I started to   say something about a man's job or woman's work, but I knew immediately that my   protests would fall on deaf ears.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>I didn't   taste a bit of breakfast that morning. Dad seemed in a jovial mood as he   described an exceptional Yankee game seen through the eyes of Mel Allen on the   radio last night.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"Mickey   Mantle drove the ball right over the center field wall," he said. "Just a   straight line climb in right out of the stadium." He looked out the window as if   trying to pick the ball out of the cloud formations. I tried to imagine Mickey   Mantle wearing an apron.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Suddenly,   everything grew quiet. My sister began to clear the table. My brother was   scraping the last of the egg from his plate. And then that ancient family ritual   that had filled so many Sunday mornings came to an end. My father announced:   "Let's go read the paper, Hon."</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"Aren't you   doing the dishes?" my mother asked fretfully.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"Your oldest   son has generously offered to fill the position."</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>My brother   and sister stopped cold. So this was what my life had come to. A dark angel sat   on my left shoulder and reminded me that I could hit a baseball farther than   anyone in my class. I could bench-press my weight. I knew three declensions in   Latin, the language of Caesar. Ask me to run through a rainstorm. Command me to   ride the roller coaster � backward. These things I would do. But I could never   do those dishes. There was nothing left but to refuse.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>People often   say there is a special chemistry between a father and a son. He came back into   the kitchen just as I was about to storm out. He had loosened his tie and rolled   up the sleeves of his shirt � ready to relax. In his right hand was the old   apron.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"I want you   to have this, Tommy. It'll keep your clothes from getting wet." And before I   could mount a protest, he had put the thing on me. "Thanks, Son. Your mother and   I appreciate this."</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>With that he   disappeared into the Sunday paper. I looked down at the plastic. It had seen   better days. I could see my dad reaching for the dishes. The dark angel flew   off. Soon I was singing about Mrs. Murphy's chowder. The words came out of   nowhere. And out of nowhere I knew the kind of man I wanted to   be.</FONT></P></DIV></DIV></div>
