  <div><DIV><FONT size=2>  <DIV class=user-face><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">In front of the person you love,   your heart beats faster, but in front of the person you like, you get happy.   <BR><BR>In front of the person you love, winter seems like spring, but in front   of the person you like, winter is just beautiful winter. <BR><BR>If you look   into the eyes of the one you love, you blush, but if you look into the eyes of   the person you like, you smile. <BR><BR>If front of the person you love, you   can't say everything on your mind, but in front of the person you like, you can.   <BR><BR>In front of the person you love, you tend to get shy, but in front of   the person you like, you can show your own self. <BR><BR>You can't look straight   into the eyes of the one you love, but you can always smile into the eyes of the   one you like. <BR><BR>When the one you love is crying, you cry with him, but   when the one you like is crying, you end up comforting. <BR><BR>The feeling of   love starts from the eye, and the feeling of like starts from the ears.   <BR><BR>So if you stop liking a person you used to like, all you need to do is   cover your ears. But if you try to close your eyes, love turns into a teardrop   and remains in your heart forever after.   </FONT></FONT></DIV></DIV></div>
