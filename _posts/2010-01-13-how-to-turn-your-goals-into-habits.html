Noble</FONT></EM></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>It's such a simple concept, yet   it's something we don't always do. It's not exceedingly difficult to do, and yet   I think it's something that would make a world of difference in anyone's   life.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Break your goals into habits,   and focus on putting those habits into autopilot.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Last week when I wrote my   Ultimate Guide to motivation, there were a number of questions about my belief   that having One Goal to focus on is much more powerful than having many   goals.</FONT></P>  <P align=left><A   href="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/language_tips/book/2008-06/10/data/attachement/jpg/site1/20080610/0013729e42d209b86d6f02.jpg"   target=_blank><FONT face=Arial><IMG id=850460 title="" border=0   alt="How to Turn Your Goals Into Habits" align=left   src="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/language_tips/book/attachement/jpg/site1/20080610/0013729e42d209b86d7d03.jpg"   zmxid="zoomXimageId6" md5="" sourcedescription="编辑提供的本地文件"   sourcename="本地文件"></FONT></A></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial></FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>There were questions about my   personal goals (such as running a marathon, eliminating debt, and so on) and how   I was able to achieve them while working on different projects, and so forth.   How can you have one goal that takes a long time, and still work on smaller   projects at the same time?</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>These are excellent questions,   and my answer takes a little explaining: I try to turn my goals into habits, and   in doing so, I put my goals on autopilot. Turning a goal into a habit means   really focusing on it, intensely, for at least a month, to the exclusion of all   else. The more you can focus on it, the more it'll be on autopilot.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>But once you put it on   autopilot, once a habit is firmly established, you don't really have to focus on   it much. You'll still do it, but because it's a habit, you only have to use   minimal focus to maintain that habit. The goal becomes on autopilot, and you can   focus on your next goal or project or habit.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><STRONG><FONT face=Arial>My Marathon   Example</FONT></STRONG></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Let's look at my marathon goal   as an example. I was just starting out in running, and I had the brilliant idea   to run a marathon within a year. (Btw, that's not the brightest idea ― you   should run for a couple years before attempting marathon training, or it'll be   much, much more difficult for you.) So that was my goal, and it was my main   focus for awhile.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>But in order to achieve that   goal, I broke it down into two habits:</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>1. I had to make running a   daily habit (while following a training plan I found online).</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>2. I had to report to people in   order to have accountability ― I did this through family, friends and coworkers,   through a blog, and through a column in my local newspaper every two weeks. With   this accountability, there's no way I would stop running.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>The daily running habit took   about a month to form. I focused on this exclusively for about a month, and   didn't have any other goals, projects or habits that were my main focuses. I did   other work projects, but they kinda took a backburner to running.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>The accountability habit took a   couple months, mainly because I didn't focus on it too much while I was building   the running habit. But it stuck, and for that first year of running, I would   report to people I knew and blog about my running every day (this was in Blogger   blog that has since been deleted), and I would write a column every two weeks   for my local paper.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Once those two habits were   firmly entrenched, my marathon goal was pretty much on autopilot. I could focus   on my debt reduction goal (as an example) without having to worry too much about   the marathon. I still had to do the work, of course, but it didn't require   constant focus.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>And eventually, I ran the   marathon. I was able to achieve this because, all year long, I had the daily   running habit and daily accountability habit. I put my marathon goal into   autopilot, and that made it much easier ― instead of struggling with it daily   for an entire year, I focused on it for one month (well, actually two) and was   able to accomplish it while focusing on new habits and   goals.</FONT></P></DIV></DIV></div>
