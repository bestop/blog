  <div><DIV><FONT face=Arial>A cab driver taught me a million dollar lesson in customer   satisfaction and expectation. Motivational speakers charge thousands of dollars   to impart this kind of training to corporate executives and staff. It cost me a   $12 taxi ride. <BR><BR>I had flown into Dallas for the sole purpose of calling   on a client. Time was of the essence and my plan included a quick turnaround   trip from and back to the airport. A spotless cab pulled up. The driver rushed   to open the passenger door for me and made sure I was comfortably seated before   he closed the door. As he got in the driver's seat, he mentioned that the neatly   folded Wall Street Journal next to me was for my use. He then showed me several   tapes and asked me what type of music I would enjoy. Well! I looked around for a   "Candid Camera!" Wouldn't you? I could not believe the service I was receiving!   I took the opportunity to say, "Obviously you take great pride in your work. You   must have a story to tell." <BR><BR>"You bet," he replied, "I used to be in   Corporate America. But I got tired of thinking my best would never be good   enough. I decided to find my niche in life where I could feel proud of being the   best I could be. I knew I would never be a rocket scientist, but I love driving   cars, being of service and feeling like I have done a full day's work and done   it well. I evaluate my personal assets andâ€¦ wham! I became a cab driver. One   thing I know for sure, to be good in my business I could simply just meet the   expectations of my passengers. But, to be great in my business, I have to exceed   the customer's expectations! I like both the sound and the return of being   'great' better than just getting by on 'average'". <BR><BR>Did I tip him big   time? You bet! Corporate America's loss is the travelling folk's   friend!</FONT></DIV></div>
