  <div><DIV>  <DIV class=3jbiaoti><FONT face=Arial>"Dr. Carr! Is it you? Is it really you?" I   turned from where I had been browsing in the bookstore to see a six-foot-six,   muscular, good-looking, smiling, sandy-haired young man calling me.</FONT></DIV>  <DIV class=3jineiwen>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"It's me, Dr. Carr!   Gibby!"</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"Gibby, it can't be. You're all   grown up!"</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Looking closer, I would have   known those eyes anywhere: serious, intense, penetrating blue eyes. Yes, It was   my Gibby, all right.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>He leaned down to hug his   former elementary principal, and my thoughts went back to that shy, overweight   little boy who transferred to our school as he began the fifth grade. He was   quiet and withdrawn then.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Gibby had a difficult time the   first few months, as do many children when they enter a new school. Some of the   boys teased him about his lack of athletic ability when he attempted to play   games on the playground. Gibby wasn't coordinated and had difficulty keeping up.   He always appeared to be stumbling over his shoestrings. Most of the time, he   was. I would remind him, "Better tie your shoestrings, Son," and he'd reply,   "Yes, ma'am, Dr. Carr."</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Often I would watch the   students playing at recess. I noticed that when they began to choose up sides   for a game, serious little Gibby would usually be left standing alone. Several   times I went out on the playground and said, "I never get to choose a team. May   I?" The boys and girls would laugh at their principal who wanted to play, and   say, "Okay, Dr. Carr, it's your turn!" I'd call out a few names and then, around   the fourth or fifth spot, I'd call Gibby's name and a few others who never   seemed to get selected by their peers. My team may not have been the best, but   we were, by far, the happiest and definitely the most committed, determined, and   loyal.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>In the early spring of Gibby's   fifth grade year, I held an exercise class on the playground during recess for   anyone who wanted to tone up their winter-weary muscles. Girls flocked to this   program, and so did a few boys. Gibby was one of those.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>We began by walking briskly   around the perimeter of the large playground. I led the pack and Gibby   invariably brought up the rear, puffing and panting and tripping over his   shoestrings. As my group circled, we would pass Gibby who was giving it his all,   but nevertheless, lagging far behind. I'd call to him, "Good going, Gibby. Keep   it up. You're getting the hang of it. Uh . . . Better tie your shoestrings,   Son."</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"Yes, ma'am, Dr. Carr," he   said, breathing hard and trying to put on a happy face.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>After a month, Gibby shed a few   pounds and didn't huff and puff as much. He still tripped over his shoestrings,   but he did keep up with the group much easier.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>By the fifth week, we had as   many boys in our exercise class as girls. I don't believe the boys were suddenly   all that interested in their health, for it was about this time the girls   decided to dress out in shorts. We added some floor exercises to our program and   held this class in the gym. Gibby was right there, in the back row, stretching   and bending, lifting and kicking, as intense as ever. Gibby never gave up or   made excuses. The little fellow just wasn't a quitter. He tried harder than   anyone, and I admired his spunk. Many of his classmates did too. In time, he   gained confidence and began to smile and talk more. He wasn't the new kid   anymore, and he began to make some solid friends.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Now, after all those years,   here we were standing in the bookstore. My little Gibby towered over   me.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"What are you doing here,   Gibby?" I asked. "I heard you have moved to Georgia."</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"Yes, Dr. Carr. I live in   Atlanta now, and I'm division manager of a computer software company. I'm   visiting my mom here this weekend," he replied.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"Well, you look good and sound   happy, Gibby."</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"I am happy, Dr. Carr. And I   think of you often. You know, it was kinda hard for me to change schools back   then and move to a new town, but you were real nice to me."</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"Why, thank you,   Gibby."</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"Yeah, you were always   laughing, and you made it fun to come to school," he said. "I'll never forget   your exercise classes. You really made us work."</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Then a big smile lit up his   face as he continued, "But, Dr. Carr, you know the thing that I remember most   about you?"</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"I have no idea, Gibby. What   was it?"</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"Well," he said, as he stared   at me with those deep blue eyes, "Whenever you got a chance to choose up sides   on the playground, you never picked me last."</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"Of course not, Gibby. You were   one of my most determined players."</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>We hugged again and he said,   "I'm married now, Dr. Carr. She's really nice and always laughing. Come to think   of it, she's a lot like you. And the best thing about her is-from everyone in   the world she could have married, she picked me. She picked me   first!"</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Tears flooded my eyes. I looked   down to avoid his gaze and try to regain my control.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>It was then that I noticed his   shoes.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"Better tie your shoestrings,"   I mumbled, wiping away my tears with the back of my hand.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"Yes, ma'am, Dr. Carr," he   replied, flashing that boyish grin.</FONT></P></DIV></DIV></div>
