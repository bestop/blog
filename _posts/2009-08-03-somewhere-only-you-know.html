Of course, I didn't suggest we go there, and so we   didn't, and the relationship came to its natural end. Looking back I don't think   the place could have breathed new life into anything at the time, anyway, but   what's striking to me is that, for a moment, I was certain that a place had the   power to do so. Such is the power of a couple's secret, private space.</P>  <P align=center>When we're growing up, forts made of blankets and secret   clubhouses provide space for friendships and crushes to develop. And if you've   seen the movie Up!, you perhaps have some thoughts on how one's childhood   clubhouse can - with a little care, fresh paint, and the right partner-in-crime   - create space for adult love to bloom.</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">As women and men grow up and   form loving adult relationships, it becomes increasingly important for couples   to create a space in which they can relax, be themselves, and grow closer. For   many couples, the bed they share may be the place to which they retreat for   feelings of safety, comfort and love - not to mention sex. A couple's bed is   where they may let down their emotional and physical guards during sleep as well   as during sex. In fact, it may be one of the few places where they can make   themselves feel entirely vulnerable to another human being.</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">For some people, trust and   security come easy. For others, learning to be vulnerable to another person is a   struggle that they may or may not win with time, practice and what feels like   great risk taking. Consequently, as damaging as affairs in any shape or form may   be, they can feel particularly threatening when a person allows their affair   into the bed they share with their partner. Betraying trust by letting someone   else into a couple's bed can feel not just hurtful, but devastating.</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">The bed is such a special   place for many women and men that it's not unusual for some couples to say that   they have their best conversations with each other when they are in bed. Maybe   they wake up on weekends feeling rested and enjoy lying together, just talking.   Perhaps before sleep, the ritual of getting undressed, settling into bed and   holding one another close allows the conversation to flow more naturally than   during the day. For some couples, it's sex that brings them closer - kissing,   hugging, touching, and naked passion may be followed by cuddling, closeness and   sharing secrets one might never think to share over breakfast, let's say, or   watching television.</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">As relationship-enhancing as a   bed or bedroom may be, others places can allow love or sex to bloom, too. A bath   tub can serve as a private sanctuary in which some couples dissect their day,   share their dreams, or seduce one another. The shower can be not only a place to   become clean but a place to start kissing or to have passionate, lustful sex.   Some couples find their special place outside the home: a fire tower nestled in   the woods in which they can take in an entire forest of autumn leaves, a park in   which they can lie down and look at clouds, or a neighborhood hotel that they   can retreat to for a night away from the kids and a chance to feel young again.   Even a living room sofa can provide comfort and closeness for a couple or family   as they huddle together to eat popcorn and watch a movie.</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">Wherever you find your special   place, know that it is important to have one and to visit it with some   regularity to keep it alive as a sanctuary and a place that matters. Spaces   become alive in the ways that they bring us closer to a partner, a family or a   group of friends. As life gets hectic and relationships become stressed, special   places can help to center a relationship. Going to bed together can feel   calming, sneaking away to your favorite hotel can ignite passion, and drawing a   fragranced bath for your significant other may just inspire romance or   re-connection. Where's your secret spot?</P></DIV></div>
