  <div><div class=Section1 style='layout-grid:15.6pt'>  <p class=MsoNormal><font size=1 face=Arial><span lang=EN-US style='font-size: 9.0pt;font-family:Arial'>All day long I had been very busy; picking up trash, cleaning bathrooms and scrubbing floors. My grown children were coming home for the weekend. I went grocery shopping and prepared for a barbecue supper, complete with ribs and chicken. I wanted everything to be perfect. <br> </span></font><font size=1 face=宋体><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family: 宋体'>　　　　</span></font><font size=1 face=Arial><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:Arial'> <br> </span></font><font size=1 face=宋体><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family: 宋体'>　　</span></font><font size=1 face=Arial><span lang=EN-US style='font-size: 9.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Suddenly, it dawned on me that I was dog-tired. I simply couldn't work as long as I could when I was younger. &quot;I've got to rest for a minute,&quot; I told my husband, <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place  w:st="on">Roy</st1:place></st1:City>, as I collapsed into my favorite rocking chair. Music was playing, my dog and cat were chasing each other and the telephone rang. <br> </span></font><font size=1 face=宋体><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family: 宋体'>　　　　</span></font><font size=1 face=Arial><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:Arial'> <br> </span></font><font size=1 face=宋体><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family: 宋体'>　　</span></font><font size=1 face=Arial><span lang=EN-US style='font-size: 9.0pt;font-family:Arial'>A scripture from Psalm 46 popped into my mind. &quot;Be still, and know that I am God.&quot; I realized that I hadn't spent much time in prayer that day. Was I too busy to even utter a simple word of thanks to God? Suddenly, the thought of my beautiful patio came to mind. I can be quiet out there, I thought. I longed for a few minutes alone with God. <br> </span></font><font size=1 face=宋体><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family: 宋体'>　　　　</span></font><font size=1 face=Arial><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:Arial'> <br> </span></font><font size=1 face=宋体><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family: 宋体'>　　</span></font><font size=1 face=Arial><span lang=EN-US style='font-size: 9.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Roy and I had invested a great deal of time and work in the patio that spring. The flowers and hanging baskets were breathtaking. It was definitely a heavenly place of rest and tranquility. If I can't be still with God in that environment, I can't be still with Him anywhere, I thought. While <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Roy</st1:place></st1:City> was talking on the telephone, I slipped out the backdoor and sat down on my favorite patio chair. I closed my eyes and began to pray, counting my many blessings. <br> </span></font><font size=1 face=宋体><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family: 宋体'>　　　　</span></font><font size=1 face=Arial><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:Arial'> <br> </span></font><font size=1 face=宋体><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family: 宋体'>　　</span></font><font size=1 face=Arial><span lang=EN-US style='font-size: 9.0pt;font-family:Arial'>A bird flew by me, chirping and singing. It interrupted my thoughts. It landed on the bird feeder and began eating dinner as I watched. After a few minutes it flew away, singing another song. <br> </span></font><font size=1 face=宋体><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family: 宋体'>　　　　</span></font><font size=1 face=Arial><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:Arial'> <br> </span></font><font size=1 face=宋体><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family: 宋体'>　　</span></font><font size=1 face=Arial><span lang=EN-US style='font-size: 9.0pt;font-family:Arial'>I closed my eyes again. A gust of wind blew, which caused my wind chimes to dance. They made a joyful sound, but again I lost my concentration on God. I squirmed and wiggled in my chair. I looked up toward the blue sky and saw the clouds moving slowly toward the horizon. The wind died down. My wind chimes finally became quiet. <br> </span></font><font size=1 face=宋体><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family: 宋体'>　　　　</span></font><font size=1 face=Arial><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:Arial'> <br> </span></font><font size=1 face=宋体><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family: 宋体'>　　</span></font><font size=1 face=Arial><span lang=EN-US style='font-size: 9.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Again, I bowed in prayer. &quot;Honk, honk,&quot; I heard. I almost jumped out of my skin. A neighbor was driving down the street. He waved at me and smiled. I waved back, happy that he cared. I quickly tried once again to settle down, repeating the familiar verse in my mind. Be still and know that I am God. <br> </span></font><font size=1 face=宋体><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family: 宋体'>　　　　</span></font><font size=1 face=Arial><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:Arial'> <br> </span></font><font size=1 face=宋体><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family: 宋体'>　　</span></font><font size=1 face=Arial><span lang=EN-US style='font-size: 9.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&quot;I'm trying God. I really am,&quot; I whispered. &quot;But you've got to help me here.&quot; <br> </span></font><font size=1 face=宋体><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family: 宋体'>　　　　</span></font><font size=1 face=Arial><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:Arial'> <br> </span></font><font size=1 face=宋体><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family: 宋体'>　　</span></font><font size=1 face=Arial><span lang=EN-US style='font-size: 9.0pt;font-family:Arial'>The backdoor opened. My husband walked outside. &quot;I love you,&quot; he said. &quot;I was wondering where you were.&quot; I chuckled, as he came over and kissed me, then turned around and went back inside. <br> </span></font><font size=1 face=宋体><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family: 宋体'>　　　　</span></font><font size=1 face=Arial><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:Arial'> <br> </span></font><font size=1 face=宋体><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family: 宋体'>　　</span></font><font size=1 face=Arial><span lang=EN-US style='font-size: 9.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&quot;Where's the quiet time?&quot; I asked God. My heart fluttered. There was no pain, only a beat that interrupted me yet again. This is impossible, I thought. There's no time to be still and to know that God is with me. There's too much going on in the world and entirely too much activity all around me. <br> </span></font><font size=1 face=宋体><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family: 宋体'>　　　　</span></font><font size=1 face=Arial><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:Arial'> <br> </span></font><font size=1 face=宋体><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family: 宋体'>　　</span></font><font size=1 face=Arial><span lang=EN-US style='font-size: 9.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Then it suddenly dawned on me. God was speaking to me the entire time I was attempting to be still. I remembered the music playing as I'd begun my quiet time. He sent a sparrow to lighten my life with song. He sent a gentle breeze. He sent a neighbor to let me know that I had a friend. He sent my sweetheart to offer sincere sentiments of love. He caused my heart to flutter to remind me of life. While I was trying to count my blessings, God was busy multiplying them. <br> </span></font><font size=1 face=宋体><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family: 宋体'>　　　　</span></font><font size=1 face=Arial><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:Arial'> <br> </span></font><font size=1 face=宋体><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family: 宋体'>　　</span></font><font size=1 face=Arial><span lang=EN-US style='font-size: 9.0pt;font-family:Arial'>I laughed to realize that the &quot;interruptions&quot; of my quiet time with God were special blessings He'd sent to show me He was with me the entire time.</span></font><font size=1 face=Arial><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:Arial'><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>  </div>  </div>
