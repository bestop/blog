  <div><div class="sanjineiwen">  <p>Here&#39;s one very simple yet potentially lifechanging advice I first heard from Brian Tracy. Cut down on the TV at night by just one hour. Instead use that hour to read books that could improve your life.</p>  <p>If you&#39;re in sales, google or browse amazon for what other people think are the best and most useful books on improving your sales.</p>  <p>This of course applies to all fields, not just the workrelated ones. Maybe you want to improve your health, become a more energetic person with a better looking body. Or maybe you want improve your productivity, your relations or perhaps do some general personal development.</p>    <p>One hour a day is not much. But if you read for one hour a day on weekdays that&#39;s about 260 hours a year. That&#39;s a lot of books and loads and loads of useful advice.</p>  <p>If applied who knows what great things and feelings could come into your life this year.</p>  <p>Also, all that cool information and useful advice will start to open up your mind. You will start to see more possibilites in your everyday life.</p>  <p>Now, now you might think something like this:</p>  <p>1. I really don&#39;t have the money...</p>  <p>Answer: Visit your local library or search their database if they got a website. Or look for used copies in places like <a href="http://amazon.com">amazon.com</a> or some more local alternative if you&#39;re outside of the US.</p>    <p>2. Yeah, ok, but I really don&#39;t have the time...</p>  <p>Answer: Buy the books as audiobooks and listen to them in the car whilst driving to and from work. Or transfer them to your mp3-player and listen while riding your bike/bus to work or school. Recently selling audiobooks directly through mp3-downloads have become popular. It&#39;s probably something we will see more and more as people and companies discover this easy (and if the technology works) smooth way of shopping.</p>    <p>So start browsing for recommendations on books or ask your friends and collegues.</p>  <p>And shut of the TV a little earlier and start reading this week.</p></div>  </div>
