  <div><DIV><FONT size=2><FONT size=3>Maybe God wants us to meet a few wrong people   before meeting the right one so that when we finally meet the right person, we   will know how to be grateful for that gift. </FONT>  <P>When the door of happiness closes, another opens, but often times we look so   long at the closed door that we don't see the one which has been opened for   us.</P>  <P>The best kind of friend is the kind you can sit on a porch and swing with,   never say a word, and then walk away feeling like it was the best conversation   you've ever had.</P>  <P>It's true that we don't know what we've got until we lose it, but it's also   true that we don't know what we've been missing until it arrives.</P>  <P>Giving someone all your love is never an assurance that they'll love you   back! Don't expect love in return; just wait for it to grow in their heart but   if it doesn't, be content it grew in yours. It takes only a minute to get a   crush on someone, an hour to like someone, and a day to love someone, but it   takes a lifetime to forget someone.</P>  <P>Don't go for looks; they can deceive. Don't go for wealth; even that fades   away. Go for someone who makes you smile because it takes only a smile to make a   dark day seem bright. Find the one that makes your heart   smile.<BR></P></FONT></DIV></div>
