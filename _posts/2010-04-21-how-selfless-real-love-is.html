  <div><DIV class=sanjineiwen>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -2.2pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>My wife   called, 'How long will you be with that newspaper? Will you come here and make   your darling daughter eat her food?</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -2.2pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>I tossed   the paper away and rushed to the scene. My only daughter, Sindu, looked   frightened; tears were welling up in her eyes. In front of her was a bowl filled   to its brim with curd rice. Sindu is a nice child, quite intelligent for her   age.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -2.2pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>I cleared   my throat and picked up the bowl. 'Sindu, darling, why don't you take a few   mouthful of this curd rice? Just for Dad's sake, dear'.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -2.2pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Sindu   softened a bit and wiped her tears with the back of her hands. 'Ok, Dad. I will   eat - not just a few mouthfuls, but the whole lot of this. But, you should...'   Sindu hesitated. 'Dad, if I eat this entire curd Rice, will you give me whatever   I ask for?'</FONT></P>  <P align=right><FONT face=Arial><IMG   style="BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 0px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 0px solid; BORDER-TOP: #000000 0px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 0px solid"   id=1283549 title="" border=0 alt="How selfless real love is 无私的爱" align=right   src="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/language_tips/book/attachement/jpg/site1/20090413/0013729e41a90b4d1be102.jpg"   width=351 height=268 zmxid="zoomXimageId6" md5="" sourcedescription="编辑提供的本地文件"   sourcename="本地文件"></FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -2.2pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>'Promise'.   I covered the pink soft hand extended by my daughter with mine, and clinched the   deal. Now I became a bit anxious. 'Sindu, dear, you shouldn't insist on getting   a computer or any such expensive items. Dad does not have that kind of money   right now. Ok?'</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -2.2pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>'No, Dad.   I do not want anything expensive'. Slowly and painfully, she finished eating the   whole quantity. I was silently angry with my wife and my mother for forcing my   child to eat something that she detested. After the ordeal was through, Sindu   came to me with her eyes wide with expectation. All our attention was on her.   'Dad, I want to have my head shaved off, this Sunday!' was her   demand.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -2.2pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT   face=Arial>'Atrocious!' shouted my wife, 'A girl child having her head shaved   off? Impossible!'</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -2.2pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>'Never in   our family!' My mother rasped. 'She has been watching too much of television.   Our culture is getting totally spoiled with these TV programs!'</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -2.2pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>'Sindu,   darling, why don't you ask for something else? We will be sad seeing you with a   clean-shaven head.'</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -2.2pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>'Please,   Sindu, why don't you try to understand our feelings?' I tried to plead with   her.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -2.2pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>'Dad, you   saw how difficult it was for me to eat that Curd Rice'. Sindu was in tears. 'And   you promised to grant me whatever I ask for. Now, you are going back on your   words. Was it not you who told me the story of King Harishchandra, and its moral   that we should honor our promises no matter what?'</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -2.2pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>It was   time for me to call the shots. 'Our promise must be kept.'</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -2.2pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>'Are you   out of your mind?' chorused my mother and wife.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -2.2pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>'No. If we   go back on our promises, she will never learn to honour her own. Sindu, your   wish will be fulfilled.'</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -2.2pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>With her   head clean-shaven, Sindu had a round-face, and her eyes looked big and   beautiful.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -2.2pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>On Monday   morning, I dropped her at her school. It was a sight to watch my hairless Sindu   walking towards her classroom. She turned around and waved. I waved back with a   smile. Just then, a boy alighted from a car, and shouted, 'Sinduja, please wait   for me!' What struck me was the hairless head of that boy. 'May be, that is the   in-stuff', I thought.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -2.2pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>'Sir, your   daughter Sinduja is great indeed!' Without introducing herself, a lady got out   of the car, and continued, 'that boy who is walking along with your daughter is   my son Harish. He is suffering from... leukemia'. She paused to muffle her sobs.   'Harish could not attend the school for the whole of the last month. He lost all   his hair due to the side effects of the chemotherapy. He refused to come back to   school fearing the unintentional but cruel teasing of the schoolmates. Sinduja   visited him last week, and promised him that she will take care of the teasing   issue. But, I never imagined she would sacrifice her lovely hair for the sake of   my son!</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -2.2pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Sir, you   and your wife are blessed to have such a noble soul as your   daughter.'</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -2.2pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>I stood   transfixed and then, I wept. 'My little Angel, you are teaching me how selfless   real love is!'</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -2.2pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>The   happiest people on this planet are not those who live on their own terms but are   those who change their terms for the ones whom they love   !!</FONT></P></DIV></div>
