It had a   glass top and slatted wooden side pockets for the morning paper&nbsp;the kind   you used to see in the movies. Mother loved her movies, and although she rarely   had breakfast in bed, she held high hopes for her daughter. My adoring   bridegroom took the message to heart.&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Feeling   guilty, I suggested we take turns. Despite grumblings -- "hate crumbs in my bed"   ---Sunday morning found my spouse eagerly awaiting his tray. Soon these weekend   breakfasts became such a part of our lives that I never even thought about them.   I only knew we treasured this separate, blissful time read, relax, forget the   things we should remember.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Sifting   through the years, I recalled how our weekends changed, but that we still   preserved the ritual. We started our family (as new parents, we slept after   breakfast more than we read), but we always found our way back to where we   started, just two for breakfast, one on Saturday and one on Sunday.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>When we   had more time, my tray became more festive. First it was fruit slices placed in   geometric pattern; then came flowers from our garden .This arranger of mine had   developed a flair for decorating, using everything from amaryllis to the buds of   a maple tree. My husband said my cooking inspired him. Mother would have   approved. Perhaps it was the Saturday when the big strawberry wore a daisy hat   that I began to think, how can I top this? One dark winter night I woke with a   vision of a snowman on a tray. That Sunday I scooped a handful of snow and in no   time had my man made. With a flourish I put a miniature pinecone on his   head.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>As I   delivered the tray, complete with a nicely frozen snowman, I waited for a   reaction. There was none but as I headed down the stairs I heard a whoop of   laughter and then, "You've won! Yes, sir, you've won the   prize!"</FONT></P></DIV></DIV></div>
