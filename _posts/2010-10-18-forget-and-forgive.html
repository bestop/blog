  <div><DIV><FONT face=Arial>As I sat perched in the second-floor window of our brick   schoolhouse that afternoon, my heart began to sink further with each passing   car. This was a day I'd looked forward to for weeks: Miss Pace's fourth-grade,   end-of-the-year party. Miss Pace had kept a running countdown on the blackboard   all that week, and our class of nine-year-olds had bordered on insurrection by   the time the much-anticipated "party Friday" had arrived.</FONT>  <DIV class=sanjineiwen>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt"><FONT face=Arial>I had happily volunteered my   mother when Miss Pace requested cookie volunteers. Mom's chocolate chips reigned   supreme on our block, and I knew they'd be a hit with my classmates. But two   o'clock passed, and there was no sign of her. Most of the other mothers had   already come and gone, dropping off their offerings of punch, crackers, cupcakes   and brownies. My mother was missing in action.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt"><FONT face=Arial>"Don't worry, Robbie, she'll be   along soon," Miss Pace said as I gazed forlornly down at the street. I looked at   the wall clock just in time to see its black minute hand shift to   half-past.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt"><FONT face=Arial>Around me, the noisy party raged   on, but I wouldn't leave my window watch post. Miss Pace did her best to coax me   away, but I just stayed there, holding out hope that the familiar family car   would round the corner, carrying my rightfully embarrassed mother with a tin of   her famous cookies tucked under her arm.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt"><FONT face=Arial>The three o'clock bell soon   jolted me from my thoughts and I dejectedly grabbed my book bag from my desk and   shuffled out the door for home.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt"><FONT face=Arial>On the walk to home, I plotted my   revenge. I would slam the front door upon entering, refuse to return her hug   when she rushed over to me, and vow never to speak to her again.</FONT></P>  <P align=center><FONT face=Arial></FONT>  <CENTER><FONT face=Arial><IMG style="WIDTH: 321px; HEIGHT: 258px" id=2359045   title="" border=0 alt="Forget and forgive 没什么，妈妈" align=center   src="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/language_tips/book/attachement/jpg/site1/20100412/0013729e41a90d2d041f39.jpg"   md5="" sourcedescription="编辑提供的本地文件" sourcename="本地文件"></FONT></CENTER>  <P><FONT face=Arial></FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt"><FONT face=Arial>The house was empty when I   arrived and I looked for a note on the refrigerator that might explain my   mother's absence, but found none. My chin quivered with a mixture of heartbreak   and rage. For the first time in my life, my mother had let me down.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt"><FONT face=Arial>I was lying face-down on my bed   upstairs when I heard her come through the front door.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt"><FONT face=Arial>"Robbie," she called out a bit   urgently. "Where are you?"</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt"><FONT face=Arial>I could then hear her darting   frantically from room to room, wondering where I could be. I remained silent. In   a moment, she mounted the steps. When she entered my room and sat beside me on   my bed, I didn't move but instead stared blankly into my pillow refusing to   acknowledge her presence.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt"><FONT face=Arial>"I'm so sorry, honey," she said.   "I just forgot. I got busy and forgot―plain and simple."</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt"><FONT face=Arial>I still didn't move. "Don't   forgive her," I told myself. "She humiliated you. She forgot you. Make her   pay."</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt"><FONT face=Arial>Then my mother did something   completely unexpected. She began to laugh. I could feel her shudder as the   laughter shook her. It began quietly at first and then increased   violently.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt"><FONT face=Arial>I was incredulous. How could she   laugh at a time like this? I rolled over and faced her, ready to let her see the   rage and disappointment in my eyes.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt"><FONT face=Arial>But my mother wasn't laughing at   all. She was crying. "I'm so sorry," she sobbed. "I let you down. I let my   little boy down."</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt"><FONT face=Arial>She sank down on the bed and   began to weep like a little girl. I was dumbstruck. I had never seen my mother   cry. To my understanding, mothers weren't supposed to.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt"><FONT face=Arial>I desperately tried to recall her   own soothing words from times past when I'd skinned knees or stubbed toes, times   when she knew just the right thing to say. But in this moment of tearful plight,   words of profundity abandoned me like a worn-out shoe.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt"><FONT face=Arial>"It's okay, Mom," I stammered as   I reached out and gently stroked her hair. "We didn't even need those cookies.   There was plenty of stuff to eat. Don't cry. It's all right. Really."</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt"><FONT face=Arial>My words, as inadequate as they   sounded to me, prompted my mother to sit up. She wiped her eyes, and a slight   smile began to crease her tear-stained cheeks. I smiled back awkwardly, and she   pulled me to her.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt"><FONT face=Arial>We didn't say another word. We   just held each other in a long, silent embrace. When we came to the point where   I would usually pull away, I decided that, this time, I could hold on, perhaps,   just a little bit longer.</FONT></P></DIV></DIV></div>
