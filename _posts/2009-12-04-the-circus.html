  <div><DIV>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Once, when I was a teenager, my   father and I were standing in line to buy tickets for the circus. Finally, there   was only one family between us and the ticket counter.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>This family made a big   impression on me. There were eight children, all probably under the age of 12.   You could tell they didn't have a lot of money.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Their clothes were not   expensive, but they were clean. The children were well-behaved, all of them   standing in line, two-by-two behind their parents, holding hands. They were   excitedly jabbering about the clowns, elephants, and other acts they would see   that night.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>One could sense they had never   been to the circus before. It promised to be a highlight of their young lives.   The father and mother were at the head of the pack, standing proud as could   be.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>The mother was holding her   husband's hand, looking up at him as if to say, "You're my knight in shining   armor."</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>He was smiling and basking in   pride, looking back at her as if to reply, "You got that right."</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>The ticket lady asked the   father how many tickets he wanted. He proudly responded, "Please let me buy   eight children's tickets and two adult tickets so I can take my family to the   circus."</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>The ticket lady quoted the   price. The man's wife let go of his hand, her head dropped, and his lip began to   quiver. The father leaned a little closer and asked, "How much did you   say?"</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>The ticket lady again quoted   the price. The man didn't have enough money.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>How was he supposed to turn and   tell his eight kids that he didn't have enough money to take them to the circus?   Seeing what was going on, my dad put his hand in his pocket, pulled out a $20   bill and dropped it on the ground. (We were not wealthy in any sense of the   word!)</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>My father reached down, picked   up the bill, tapped the man on the shoulder and said, "Excuse me, sir, this fell   out of your pocket."</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>The man knew what was going on.   He wasn't begging for a handout but certainly appreciated the help in a   desperate, heartbreaking, embarrassing situation. He looked straight into my   dad's eyes, took my dad's hand in both of his, squeezed tightly onto the $20   bill, and with his lip quivering and a tear running down his cheek, he replied,   "Thank you, thank you, sir. This really means a lot to me and my   family."</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>My father and I went back to   our car and drove home. We didn't go to the circus that night, but we didn't go   without.<BR></FONT></P></DIV></div>
