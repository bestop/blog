  <div><DIV>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>You've probably seen the   message, "Please consider the environment before printing this e-mail," at the   end of e-mails you receive.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Adding a green message to your   e-mail signature can be an effective way to draw notice. After all, the people   you're e-mailing know you. If you care about the environment, they may wonder   what more they can do as well.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial></FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial></FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Here's a story to illustrate my   point. Michael, that's my husband in case you didn' know, added an e-mail   signature like the one above to his work e-mails. Others in his department   started doing the same. In a staff meeting, the organizer said something like,   "Well, I didn't print out an agenda for everyone this time because of all that   save-the-paper messages in your e-mails. I wrote it on the board   instead."</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>That's a small, but great   change. E-mail signatures can help people think. Now here's something for you to   think about:</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Do you actually refer back to   those e-mails you print? How often can you make PDFs of documents instead of   printing them?</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Here are some e-mail signatures   I came up with just for you to consider:</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>•If you hug a tree, you'll be   hugged back twice. Please think about not printing this e-mail.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>•Trees like you, so please wink   back by not printing this e-mail.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>•Love a tree, don't hit   print.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>•Make sense, not waste. Don't   hit print.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>•Ask me why you should think   twice before printing this e-mail.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>•Does e-mail make us print more   than we did before?</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>•You're too smart to print this   e-mail.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>•Lower your impact today by not   printing this e-mail.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>•Even recycled paper takes   energy to make. Do you really need to print this e-mail?</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>If you have a green e-mail   signature, please tell us about it.</FONT></P></DIV></div>
