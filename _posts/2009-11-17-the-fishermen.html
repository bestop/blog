  <div><P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>There was a group called "The   Fisherman's Fellowship". They were surrounded by streams and lakes full of   hungry fish. They met regularly to discuss the call to fish, and the thrill of   catching fish. They got excited about fishing!!</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Someone suggested that they   needed a philosophy of fishing, so they carefully defined and redefined fishing,   and the purpose of fishing. They developed fishing strategies and tactics. Then   they realized that they had been going at it backwards. They had approached   fishing from the point of view of the fisherman, and not from the point of view   of the fish. How do fish view the world? How does the fisherman appear to the   fish? What do fish eat, and when? These are all good things to know. So they   began research studies, and attended conferences on fishing. Some traveled to   far away places to study different kinds of fish, with different habits. Some   got PhD's in fishology. But no one had yet gone fishing.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>So a committee was formed to   send out fishermen. As prospective fishing places outnumbered fishermen, the   committee needed to determine priorities.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>A priority list of fishing   places was posted on bulletin boards in all of the fellowship halls. But still,   no one was fishing. A survey was launched, to find out why… Most did not answer   the survey, but from those that did, it was discovered that some felt called to   study fish, a few to furnish fishing equipment, and several to go around   encouraging the fisherman.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>What with meetings,   conferences, and seminars, they just simply didn't have time to fish.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Now, Jake was a newcomer to the   Fisherman's Fellowship. After one stirring meeting of the Fellowship, Jake went   fishing. He tried a few things, got the hang of it, and caught a choice fish. At   the next meeting, he told his story, and he was honored for his catch, and then   scheduled to speak at all the Fellowship chapters and tell how he did it. Now,   because of all the speaking invitations and his election to the board of   directors of the Fisherman's Fellowship, Jake no longer has time to go   fishing.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>But soon he began to feel   restless and empty. He longed to feel the tug on the line once again. So he cut   the speaking, he resigned from the board, and he said to a friend, "Let's go   fishing." They did, just the two of them, and they caught fish.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>The members of the Fisherman's   Fellowship were many, the fish were plentiful, but the fishers were   few.</FONT></P>  <DIV><FONT face=Arial></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV></div>
