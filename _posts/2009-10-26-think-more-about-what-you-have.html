  <div class="post"><h2>{{ page.title }}</h2><strong>{{ page.date | date_to_long_string }}</strong><div><DIV>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT size=2 face="Comic Sans MS">One of the   more pervasive and destructive mental tendencies I've seen is that of focusing   on what we want instead of what we have. It doesn't seem to make my difference   how much we have, we just keep expanding our list of desires, which guarantees   we will remain dissatisfied. The mind-set that says "I'll be happy" when this   desire is fulfilled is the same mind-set that will repeat itself once that   desire is met.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT size=2 face="Comic Sans MS">We want this   or that. If we don't get what we want, we keep thinking about all that we don't   have and we remain dissatisfied. If we do get what we want, we simply recreate   the same thinking in our new circumstances. So, despite getting what we want, we   still remain unhappy. Happiness can't be found when we are yearning for new   desires.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT size=2 face="Comic Sans MS">Luckily, there   is a way to be happy. It involves changing the emphasis of our thinking from   what we want to what we have. Rather than wishing you were able to take a   vacation to Hawaii, think of how much fun you have had close to home. The list   of possibilities is endless! Each time you notice yourself falling into the "I   wish life were different" trap, back off and start over. Take a breath and   remember all that you have to be grateful. When you focus not on what you want,   but on what you have, you end up getting more of what you want anyway. If you   focus on the good qualities of your spouse, she'll be more loving. If you are   grateful for your job rather than complaining about it, you'll do a better job,   be more productive, and probably end up getting a raise any-way. If you focus on   ways to enjoy yourself around home rather than waiting to enjoy yourself in   Hawaii, you'll end up having more fun. If you ever do get to Hawaii, you'll be   in the habit of enjoying yourself. And, if by some chance you don't, you have a   great life anyway.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT size=2 face="Comic Sans MS">Make a note of   yourself to start thinking more about what you have than what you want. If you   do, your life will start appearing much better than before. For perhaps the   first time in your life, you'll know what it means to feel   satisfied.</FONT></P></DIV></div>
