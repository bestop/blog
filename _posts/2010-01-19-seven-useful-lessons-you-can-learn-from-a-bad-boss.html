  <div><DIV>  <DIV class=sanjiriqi><FONT face=Arial>Macho, insensitive bosses share certain   characteristics. Their behavior is arrogant, quick-tempered and controlling.   Their motives are typically selfish and manipulative. They show little concern   for others and few signs of understanding why others don't trust them. Most of   all, they are quite unaware of their failings and the impact they have on their   subordinates. No only do they see no need to change, they often make their   high-handed behavior a source of pride.</FONT></DIV>  <DIV class=sanjineiwen>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>That's why you can trust them   to be some of your best teachers about productivity and success.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Before you decide that I've   lost my mind, I'll explain.</FONT></P>  <P align=center><FONT face=Arial></FONT></P>  <P align=left><FONT face=Arial><IMG style="WIDTH: 200px; HEIGHT: 301px"   id=856216 title="" border=0   alt="Seven Useful Lessons You Can Learn from a Bad Boss" align=left   src="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/language_tips/book/attachement/jpg/site1/20080616/0013729e42d209c057de01.jpg"   md5="" sourcedescription="编辑提供的本地文件" sourcename="本地文件"></FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial></FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Most human beings are amazingly   consistent in the way they behave. That's why we can say of some action, "That   isn't like you," or "It's so out of character." Without that consistency, such a   remark would be pointless. And amongst the most consistent groups of all are   those who spend least time in any kind of introspection: the extreme extroverts,   the loud, slap-you-on-the-back hearty types, the arrogant, the pompous, the   selfish and the self-centered ― the people who, if they become bosses, are most   likely to prove to be bad ones.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Powerful lessons from powerful   (and hopelessly unaware) people<BR><BR>Bad bosses can become useful teachers   precisely because their behavior tends to be so consistently bad. You can be   fairly sure of their motives and intentions, which allows you to compare cause   (what they did and probably why they did it) with effect (how it turned   out).</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>The pompous boss, convinced of   her superiority and the rightness of whatever she does; the lazy boss, sure that   status confers the right to live off other people's efforts; the rigid,   controlling boss, firm in his belief that all subordinates are incompetent   without his oversight; all of these (and many more) hold to their actions so   tenaciously ― and are so blind to what they are doing ― that they will provide   some of the best lessons in what not to do that you will ever be   offered.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Here are seven of the lessons   you might come across, beginning with productivity:</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>See how much effort bad bosses   have to use to make things happen their way; effort that would be unnecessary if   they behaved better ― all that time spent micro-managing and checking; all the   ranting and raving to reduce others to obedience; all the lies and stratagems   needed to manipulate others instead of asking them openly.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>See how others react to them;   how people become adept at sabotaging their efforts and undermining their   success. Even when they dare not oppose the boss openly, subordinates will show   great ingenuity in finding other ways to frustrate them.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Look at the effect bad bosses   have on trust ― how this type of behavior ruins relationships with customers as   well as employees. Once discovered, as it always is in the end, cynical   manipulation renders future trust impossible too.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>What about the impact on   motivation? Consider how you feel if you find yourself going along with the   boss's bad behavior. Do you feel motivated or depressed? Does it make you want   to exert yourself or limit your output to no more than is needed to preserve   your safety and career prospects?</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Rigidity next. Most macho   bosses see changing a poor decision as an unacceptable sign of weakness. How   many times have you seen a bad leader produce disaster from what could have been   a triumph, simply because he or she refused to admit to ― and change ― a bad   decision?</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Take some time to consider what   survival in the lifestyle of a bad boss demands. Is that how you would be   willing to live? Are the rewards they get worth what they have to do to get   them?</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Most important, observe the way   bad bosses are regarded by those above them. Are they genuinely fooling the top   dogs about their weaknesses? Or are those executives simply playing the same   game ― but far better ― manipulating middle and junior managers to enhance their   own positions, then throwing them to the wolves when they become too much of an   embarrassment? I'm sure you can think of many more situations where a bad boss   has taught you a valuable lesson. Observing and learning from others' mistakes   is as important as learning from your own ― and a good deal less   painful.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Besides, the macho tough guys   can never admit to being wrong. They can't learn from their own mistakes. Since   you can, it's an advantage you can use for all it's   worth.</FONT></P></DIV></DIV></div>
