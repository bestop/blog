  <div><DIV><FONT size=2>We have bigger houses and smaller families; more conveniences,   but less time; we have more degrees, but less common sense; more knowledge, but   less judgement; more experts, but more problems; more medicine, but less   wellness.</FONT></DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV><FONT size=2>We spend too recklessly, laugh too little, drive too fast, get   to angry too quickly, stay up too late, get up too tired, read too little, watch   TV too often, and pray too seldom.</FONT></DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV><FONT size=2>We have multiplied our possessions, but reduced our values. We   talk too much, love too little and lie too often. We've learned how to make a   living, but not a life; we've added years to life, not life to   years.</FONT></DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV><FONT size=2>We have taller buildings, but shorter tempers; wider freeways,   but narrower viewpoints. We spend more, but have less; we buy more, but enjoy it   less.</FONT></DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV><FONT size=2>We've been all the way to the moon and back, but have trouble   crossing the street to meet the new neighbor. We've conquered outer space, but   not inner space. We've split the atom, but not our prejudice; we write more, but   learn less; plan more, but accomplish less.</FONT></DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV><FONT size=2>We've learned to rush, but not to wait; we have higher   incomes, but lower morals. We build more computers to hold more information, to   produce more copies, but have less communication. We are long on quantity, but   short on quality.</FONT></DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV><FONT size=2>These are the times of fast foods and slow digestion; tall men   and short character; steep profits and shallow relationships. More leisure and   less fun; more kinds of food, but less nutrition; two incomes, but more divorce;   fancier houses, but broken homes.</FONT></DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV><FONT size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV></div>
