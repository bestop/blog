She has never put it on.   Was saving it for a special occasion.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Well, I guess   this is it. He got near the bed and placed the gift box next to the other   clothings he was taking to the funeral house, his wife had just died. He turned   to me and said:</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"Never save   something for a special occasion. Every day in your life is a special   occasion".</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>I still think   those words changed my life. Now I read more and clean less. I sit on the porch   without worrying about anything. I spend more time with my family, and less at   work. I understood that life should be a source of experience to be lived up to,   not survived through. I no longer keep anything. I use crystal glasses every   day. I'll wear new clothes to go to the supermarket, if i feel like it. I don't   save my special perfume for special occasions, I use it whenever I want to. The   words "Someday..." and "One Day..." are fading away from my dictionary. If it's   worth seeing, listening or doing, I want to see, listen or do it now.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>I don't know   what my friend's wife would have done if she knew she wouldn't be there the next   morning, this nobody can tell. I think she might have called her relatives and   closest friends.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>She might   call old friends to make peace over past quarrels. I'd like to think she would   go out for Chinese, her favourite food. It's these small things that I would   regret not doing, if I knew my time had come. I would regret it, because I would   no longer see the friends I would meet, letters... letters that i wanted to   write "One of this days". I would regret and feel sad, because I didn't say to   my brothers and sons, not times enough at least, how much I love   them.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Now, I try   not to delay, postpone or keep anything that could bring laughter and joy into   our lives. And, on each morning, I say to myself that this could be a special   day. Each day, each hour, each minute, is   special.</FONT></P></DIV></DIV></div>
