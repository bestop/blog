  <div><DIV><FONT size=2>Tears goes out of my eyes when I talk to my parents on the   phone. What are they doing when I call them, this is what I&nbsp;&nbsp; want to   know most. I had supper at 5 o'clock in the dining room. There is no need for me   to cook by myself, no need to wash the dishes. However, now it is the busiest   time for my parents. Dad has night shift every day, he works from seven   o'clock&nbsp; in the morning to nine o'clock in the evening. Therefore, all the   housework is left to my mum, besides her own job, she also has to work the   vineyard.</FONT></DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV><FONT size=2>Every day she gets up at 4 o'clock in the morning, then works   till dark. One day I called her at 7:30 in the evening, she told me that she was   still in the vineyard and hadn't had supper yet. My tears ran down from my   cheeks, I was filled with worry. I promise her to study hard in the university,   because I am her hope. I promise her to take care of myself, because I am   important to her. I promise her to lose weight because she says nice figure is   an important factor in future's competition. I promise her so much and I just   want her to promise me that she can take care of herself and dad because they   are just like the blood in my body.I cannot live without them.</FONT></DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV><FONT size=2>In my family, everyone is common. We are willing to earn our   living by our own hands. We are very happy to have the meal together on the New   Year's Eve. My mother has ever said that everyone in the family is important, no   one can be absent.</FONT></DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV><FONT size=2>Mum has ever said that the happiest time for Dad and her is   when my sister and I come back home.</FONT></DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV><FONT size=2>We play cards in the room,watch TV,do anything we like,with   dad and mum preparing delicious food in the kitchen.It is also the happiest time   for me.</FONT></DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV><FONT size=2>At that moment,I could forget all the difficulties and   unhappiness.The only thing I would like to do is to enjoy the time with my   parents.</FONT></DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV><FONT size=2>Love,sometimes,doesn't need much words.Love your parents like   they love us.Give them a call,tell them you miss them...<BR></FONT></DIV>  <DIV><FONT size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV></div>
