  <div>Hello folks:想要用英文展现一下你的幽默感, 但却苦无机会吗? 下面的资料都是我从网路上找来的(原作者不要打我!), 提供大家很好的题材.. <br />　　How Come <br />　　A man will pay $2 for a $1 item he wants. A woman will pay $1 for a $2 item that she doesn't want. <br />　　 <br />　　How Come <br />　　A woman worries about the future until she gets a husband. A man never worries about the future until he gets a wife. <br />　　How Come <br />　　A successful man is one who makes more money than his wife can spend. A successful woman is one who can find such a man. <br />　　 <br />　　How Come <br />　　To be happy with a woman you must love her a lot. And not try to understand her at all. <br />　　 <br />　　How Come <br />　　Married men live longer than single men. But married men are a lot more willing to die. <br />　　 <br />　　How Come <br />　　Any married man should forget his mistakes. There's no use in two people remembering the same thing. <br />　　 <br />　　How Come <br />　　Men wake up as good-looking as they went to bed. Women somehow deteriorate during the night. <br />　　 <br />　　How Come <br />　　A woman marries a man expecting he will change, but he doesn't. A man marries a woman expecting that she won't change and she does. <br />　　 <br />　　How Come <br />　　A woman has the last word in any argument. Anything a man says after that is the beginning of a new argument. <br />　　 <br />　　How Come <br />　　There are two times when a man doesn't understand a woman, before marriage and after marriage. <br />　　 <br />　　How Come <br />　　If a man talks dirty to a woman it's sexual harassment If a woman talks dirty to a man it's nine dollars a minute. <br />　　 <br />　　p.s How Come 就是: 为什么会这样呢??</div>
