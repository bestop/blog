  <div><DIV>  <DIV class=sanjineiwen>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Located in   the checkroom in Union Station as I am, I see everybody that comes up the   stairs.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Harry came in   a little over three years ago and waited at the head of the stairs for the   passengers from the 9:05 train.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>I remember   seeing Harry that first evening. He wasn't much more than a thin, anxious kid   then. He was all dressed up and I knew he was meeting his girl and that they   would be married twenty minutes after she arrived.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Well, the   passengers came up and I had to get busy. I didn't look toward the stairs again   until nearly time for the 9:18 and I was very surprised to see that the young   fellow was still there.</FONT></P>  <P align=right><FONT face=Arial><IMG style="WIDTH: 388px; HEIGHT: 262px"   id=1921806 title="" border=0 alt="Detour to romance 曲折的浪漫路" align=right   src="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/language_tips/book/attachement/jpg/site1/20091029/0013729e41a90c538cad07.jpg"   md5="" sourcedescription="编辑提供的本地文件" sourcename="本地文件"></FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>She didn't   come on the 9:18 either, nor on the 9:40, and when the passengers from the 10:02   had all arrived and left, Harry was looking pretty desperate. Pretty soon he   came close to my window so I called out and asked him what she looked   like.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"She's small   and dark," he said, "and nineteen years old and very neat in the way she walks.   She has a face," he said, thinking a minute, "that has lots of spirit. I mean   she can get mad but she never stays mad for long, and her eyebrows come to a   little point in the middle. She's got a brown fur, but maybe she isn't wearing   it."</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>I couldn't   remember seeing anybody like that.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>He showed me   the telegram he'd received: ARRIVE THURSDAY. MEET ME STATION. LOVE LOVE LOVE   LOVE. MAY. It was from Omaha, Nebraska.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"Well," I   finally said, "why don't you phone to your home? She's probably called there if   she got in ahead of you."</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>He gave me a   sick look. "I've only been in town two days. We were going to meet and then   drive down South where I've got a job. She hasn't any address for me." He   touched the telegram.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>When I came   on duty the next day he was still there and came over as soon as he saw   me.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"Did she work   anywhere?" I asked.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>He nodded.   "She was a typist. I telegraphed her former boss. All they know is that she left   her job to get married."</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Harry met   every train for the next three or four days. Of course, the railroad lines made   a routine checkup and the police looked into the case. But nobody was any real   help. I could see that they all figured that May had simply played a trick on   him. But I never believed that, somehow.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>One day,   after about two weeks, Harry and I were talking and I told him about my theory.   "If you'll just wait long enough," I said, "you'll see her coming up those   stairs some day." He turned and looked at the stairs as though he had never seen   them before.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>The next day   when I came to work Harry was behind the counter of Tony's magazine stand. He   looked at me rather sheepishly and said, "Well, I had to get a job somewhere,   didn't I?"</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>So he began   to work as a clerk for Tony. We never spoke of May anymore and neither of us   ever mentioned my theory. But I noticed that Harry always saw every person who   came up the stairs.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Toward the   end of the year Tony was killed in some argument over gambling, and Tony's widow   left Harry in complete charge of the magazine stand. And when she got married   again some time later, Harry bought the stand from her. He borrowed money and   installed a soda fountain and pretty soon he had a very nice little   business.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Then came   yesterday. I heard a cry and a lot of things falling. The cry was from Harry and   the things falling were a lot of dolls and other things which he had upset while   he was jumping over the counter. He ran across and grabbed a girl not ten feet   from my window. She was small and dark and her eyebrows came to a little point   in the middle.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>For a while   they just hung there to each other laughing and crying and saying things without   meaning. She'd say a few words like, "It was the bus station I meant" and he'd   kiss her speechless and tell her the many things he had done to find her. What   apparently had happeded three years before was that May had come by bus, not by   train, and in her telegram she meant "bus station," not "railroad station." She   had waited at the bus station for days and had spent all her money trying to   find Harry. Finally she got a job typing.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"What?" said   Harry. "Have you been working in town? All the time?"</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>She   nodded.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"Well,   Heavens. Didn't you ever come down here to the station?" He pointed across to   his magazine stand. "I've been there all the time. I own it. I've watched   everybody that came up the stairs."</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>She began to   look a little pale. Pretty soon she looked over at the stairs and said in a weak   voice, "I never came up the stairs before. You see, I went out of town yesterday   on a short business trip. Oh, Harry!" Then she threw her arms around his neck   and really began to cry.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>After a   minute she backed away and pointed very stiffly toward the north end of the   station. "Harry, for three years, for three solid years, I've been right over   there working right in this very station, typing, in the office of the   stationmaster."</FONT></P></DIV></DIV></div>
