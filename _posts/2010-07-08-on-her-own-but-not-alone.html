  <div><DIV>  <DIV class=sanjineiwen>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -2.2pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Marjorie   Baer used to joke about her retirement plans. She wasn't married and had no   kids, but she didn't intend to be alone―she and all her single friends would   move into a fictional home she called Casa de Biddies. Instead, Baer developed   terminal brain cancer when she was 52. But just as she'd hoped, her friends and   family provided her with love and care to the end.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -2.2pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Baer's   friends Lee Ballance and Mary Selkirk were walking their dog one afternoon in   July 2006 when they saw an ambulance in front of her house. Baer had had a   seizure and collapsed. Ballance, a physician, hopped in his car and followed the   ambulance to the hospital to be at Baer's side while doctors tried to figure out   what was going on. When they did, the news wasn't good: She had glioblastoma   multiforme, a particularly aggressive form of brain cancer.</FONT></P>  <P align=center><FONT face=Arial></FONT>  <CENTER><FONT face=Arial><IMG style="WIDTH: 400px; HEIGHT: 267px" id=2027098   title="" border=0 alt="On her own, but not alone 她并不孤独" align=center   src="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/language_tips/book/attachement/jpg/site1/20091207/0013729e41a90c86fcc347.jpg"   md5="" sourcedescription="编辑提供的本地文件" sourcename="本地文件"></FONT></CENTER>  <P><FONT face=Arial></FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -2.2pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Ballance   was only the first of Baer's friends who became her unofficial caregivers. Until   her brother Phil Baer put his marriage and work in Los Angeles on hold to care   for his sister during her final weeks, they cobbled together a system to watch   over their friend and allow her to keep some of the privacy and independence she   cherished.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -2.2pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Baer's   good friend Ruth Henrich took the lead. That seemed natural: Henrich, then 58,   and Baer both worked in publishing and lived in the same duplex. Though busy in   her job as an associate managing editor at salon.com, Henrich took Baer to   doctors' appointments and helped her deal with all the aspects of life that were   becoming increasingly mysterious to her―answering machines, TV controls, and   even phone numbers. After Henrich sent out an e-mail request, a group of   volunteers signed up to ferry Baer back and forth to radiation therapy. Others   in Baer's circle offered up particular talents: A nurse friend helped Baer   figure out how to get what she was due from Social Security and her disability   insurance; an attorney pal helped Baer with her will; a buddy who was an   accountant took over her bills when she could no longer manage them. "There was   this odd sense that the right person always showed up," says   Ballance.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -2.2pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Not that   it was easy. "I had to know at all times who was going to be there and   anticipate what Marjorie would need next, so it was always on my mind," says   Henrich. "It was something I wanted to do, but it also never went away." Still,   their jury-rigged arrangement worked remarkably well. Even as Baer lost the   ability to read and write and engage in conversation over the course of the   year, she was able to continue to live on her own, walk to the market, take the   subway to painting classes, and even fly to Iowa by herself to visit her brother   Tom and his family.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -2.2pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"She was a   generous person," says another friend, Elizabeth Whipple, "and it came back to   her in truckloads."</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -2.2pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Unmarried   women are one of the fastest-growing demographic groups in America, and   increasing numbers of men are remaining single, too; experts are concerned about   how caregiving will be managed for both groups as they age. If the experience of   Baer's friends is a guide, the Internet will play a role. It's already making it   possible to create communities of caregivers who may have only one thing in   common: the person who needs their help. On personal "care pages" set up through   services such as Lotsa Helping Hands, friends and family members can post a list   of tasks that need to be done, volunteer to do them, and keep updated on the   person's condition. As Baer's cancer progressed, for example, her friends set up   a page on Yahoo! where people could sign up to deliver meals or do   errands.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -2.2pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT   face=Arial>Eventually, their help wasn't enough. One morning, a year after   Baer's diagnosis, Henrich checked in before work and found Baer on the floor.   Though she wore a panic button on a chain around her neck, she hadn't used it.   "I don't know how long she had been there," Henrich says.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -2.2pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>That was   when Baer's brother Phil stepped in. He and Tom had taken turns earlier making   trips to Berkeley to care for their sister; now Phil, who lived in Los Angeles,   took leave from his job as head of air-conditioning and heating at CBS Studio   Center―and from his understanding wife, Joyce―to care for Baer full-time. "There   was just no question in my mind that I would do anything I could, including   switch places with Marjorie," he says. "It made me realize how much I loved   her."</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -2.2pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>For the   next few weeks, Phil looked after her during the day. He oversaw the nighttime   caregivers and consulted with the hospice workers who assisted with medical   issues and helped him prepare for Baer's death. But even then, his sister's   loyal friends were irreplaceable, he says, providing both practical and   emotional sustenance.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -2.2pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Several of   Baer's friends were there when she died. "We were all trying to help ease her   passing," says Whipple. "Phil put his hands on her chest, and she let   go."</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -2.2pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Catherine   Fox, one of the friends who was present when Baer died, was deeply affected. "It   was so comforting to know that if you're willing to ask for help, the generosity   of family and friends can be phenomenal. It makes me feel secure and hopeful to   know that help is there when you need it."</FONT></P></DIV></DIV></div>
