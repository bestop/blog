  <div><DIV>  <DIV class=sanjineiwen>  <P><FONT style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt" size=3 face=Arial>What would you do if you only   had a short time to live?</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>It's hard, from within the storm of every day life, to see   things with real perspective, to know what's important and what's simply   pressing on our consciousness right now, demanding attention.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>We have people emailing us for information and requesting   action, we have phone calls and visitors and a long to-do list and a million   chores and errands to run and all of the slings and arrows of our daily reality   … and yet, what is important?</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>Ask yourself this: if you suddenly found out you only had 6   months to live (for whatever reason), would the thing in front of you matter to   you?</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>Would those 20 emails waiting for a response matter? Would   the paperwork waiting to be processed matter? Would the work you're doing   matter? Would the meetings you're supposed to have matter? Would a big car and   nice house and high-paying job and cool computer and mobile device and nice   shoes and clothes matter?</FONT></P>  <P align=right><FONT face=Arial><IMG   style="BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 0px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 0px solid; BORDER-TOP: #000000 0px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 0px solid"   id=1792413 title="" border=0 alt="Cherish rest of your life 珍惜余生" align=right   src="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/language_tips/book/attachement/jpg/site1/20090903/0013729e41a90c09b6ac1c.jpg"   width=362 height=253 md5="" sourcedescription="编辑提供的本地文件"   sourcename="本地文件"></FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>I'm not saying they wouldn't matter … but it's important to   ask yourself if they would.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>What would matter to you?</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>For many of us, it's the loved ones in our lives. If we   don't have loved ones … maybe it's time we started figuring out why, and   addressing that. Maybe we haven't made time for others, for getting out and   meeting others and helping others and being compassionate and passionate about   others. Maybe we have shut ourselves in somehow. Or maybe we do have loved ones   in our lives, but we don't seem to have the time we want to spend with   them.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>When was the last time you told your loved ones you loved   them? Spent good quality time with them, being in the moment?</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>For many of us, doing work that matters … would matter. That   might mean helping others, or making a vital contribution to society, or   creating something brilliant and inspiring, or expressing ourselves somehow.   It's not the money that matters, but the impact of the work. Are you doing work   that matters?</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>For many of us, experiencing life would matter ― really   being in the moment, finding passion in our lives, seeing the world and   traveling, or just seeing the world that's around us right now, being with great   people, doing amazing things, eating amazing food, playing.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>These are just a few ideas … but what would matter to   you?</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>I highly recommend that you spend at least a little time   now, and regularly, thinking about this question … figuring out what really   matters … and living a life that shows this.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>How do you live a life that puts a great emphasis on what   matters? Start by figuring out what matters, and what doesn't. Then eliminate as   much as you can of the stuff that doesn't matter, or at least minimize it to the   extent possible. Make room for what does matter.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>Make the time for what does matter … today. Put it on your   schedule, and don't miss that appointment. Make those tough decisions ― because   choosing to live a life that is filled with the important stuff means making   choices, and they're not always easy choices. But it matters.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>Spend time with your significant other, show them how   important they are. Take the time to cuddle with your child, to read with her,   to play with her, to have good conversations with her, to take walks with her.   Take time to be in nature, to appreciate the beauty of the world around us. Take   time to savor the little pleasures in life.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>Because while you might not have only 6 months to live, I'm   here to break the news to you: you really do only have a short time to live.   Whether that's 6 months, 6 years or 60 … it's but the blink of an   eye.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>The life you have left is a gift. Cherish it. Enjoy it now,   to the fullest. Do what matters, now.</FONT></P></DIV></DIV></div>
