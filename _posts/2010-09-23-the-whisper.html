  <div class="post"><h2>{{ page.title }}</h2><strong>{{ page.date | date_to_long_string }}</strong><div><DIV>  <DIV class=sanjiriqi><FONT face=Arial>Recently, I heard a touching story which   illustrates the power that words have to change a life -- a power that lies   right in the hands of those reading this article. Mary had grown up knowing that   she was different from the other kids, and she hated it. She was born with a   cleft palate and had to bear the jokes and stares of cruel children who teased   her non-stop about her misshaped lip, crooked nose, and garbled speech. With all   the teasing, Mary grew up hating the fact that she was "different". She was   convinced that no one, outside her family, could ever love her ... until she   entered Mrs. Leonard's class.</FONT></DIV>  <DIV class=sanjineiwen>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Mrs. Leonard   had a warm smile, a round face, and shiny brown hair. While everyone in her   class liked her, Mary came to love Mrs. Leonard. In the 1950's, it was common   for teachers to give their children an annual hearing test. However, in Mary's   case, in addition to her cleft palate, she was barely able to hear out of one   ear. Determined not to let the other children have another "difference" to point   out, she would cheat on the test each year. The "whisper test" was given by   having a child walk to the classroom door, turn sideways, close one ear with a   finger, and then repeat something which the teacher whispered. Mary turned her   bad ear towards her teacher and pretended to cover her good ear. She knew that   teachers would often say things like, "The sky is blue," or "What color are your   shoes?" But not on that day. Surely, God put seven words in Mrs. Leonard's mouth   that changed Mary's life forever. When the "Whisper test" came, Mary heard the   words: "I wish you were my little girl."</FONT></P>  <P align=center><FONT face=Arial></FONT>  <DIV align=center><FONT face=Arial><IMG style="WIDTH: 300px; HEIGHT: 302px"   id=2260764 title="" border=0 alt="The whisper 让我轻声鼓励你" align=center   src="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/language_tips/book/attachement/jpg/site1/20100304/0013729e41a90cf9a94c1a.jpg"   sourcename="本地文件" sourcedescription="编辑提供的本地文件" md5=""></FONT></DIV>  <P><FONT face=Arial></FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Dads, I wish   there was some way that I could communicate to you the incredible blessing which   affirming words impart to children. I wish, too, that you could sit in my   office, when I counsel, and hear the terrible damage that individuals received   from not hearing affirming words--particularly affirming words from a father.   While words from a godly teacher can melt a heart, words from a father can   powerfully set the course of a life.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>If affirming   words were something rarely spoken in your home growing up, let me give you some   tips on words and phrases that can brighten your own child's eyes and life.   These words are easy to say to any child who comes into your life. I'm proud of   you, Way to go, Bingo ... you did it, Magnificent, I knew you could do it, What   a good helper, You're very special to me, I trust you, What a treasure, Hurray   for you, Beautiful work, You're a real trooper, Well done, That's so creative,   You make my day, You're a joy, Give me a big hug, You're such a good listener,   You figured it out, I love you, You're so responsible, You remembered, You're   the best, You sure tried hard, I've got to hand it to you, I couldn't be prouder   of you, You light up my day, I'm praying for you, You're wonderful, I'm behind   you, You're so kind to your (brother/sister), You're God's special gift, I'm   here for you.</FONT></P></DIV></DIV></div>
