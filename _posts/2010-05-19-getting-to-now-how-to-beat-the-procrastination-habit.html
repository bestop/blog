  <div><DIV>  <P><FONT face=Arial>I am a procrastinator. I always have been. It's a character   flaw, and I admit it. I've tried all sorts of things to beat the habit ― Getting   Things Done, e-mail reminders, dozens of list systems ― but the only thing that   seems to work is to: <EM>Do it now</EM>.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>This is blindingly obvious, I know, but many people lose   sight of this fundamental skill. It's not that we don't know that we should do   things now; it's that we've forgotten how. Here are some techniques I've been   using to try to force myself to get to now:</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial><STRONG>Set aside blocks of time to do things</STRONG>. When   I was talking with my wellness coach earlier this year, she asked me why I   didn't exercise more often. "I don't have the time," I said. "Something always   comes up." She wasn't impressed. "J.D.," she said, "You have to make time. Make   an appointment with yourself to run or to go for a bike ride." The same   principle applies to other things you might procrastinate.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>Kris and I used to schedule a block of time on Saturday   morning specifically to clean the house. Each week we'd tackle a different room.   If we didn't do this, I'd just put it off for weeks (or months). Pick an hour a   day to get things done.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial><STRONG>If it comes to mind, then do it</STRONG>. Often I'll   be sitting on the back porch reading a book, and it will occur to me that some   chore needs to be done ― pruning the laurel hedge, for example. "I need to write   that down so I can remember it," I tell myself. Wrong! What usually happens is   that I forget to write it down, and even if I do, I just look at the list and   procrastinate for weeks on end. The best move is to actually do the chore when I   think of it. (Assuming, of course, that I have the time at that moment. Which I   usually do.)</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial><STRONG>Use a timer to bring you back to reality</STRONG>.   Part of the reason I procrastinate is that I have a rich mental life. This is   just a flowery way of saying that I'm a daydreamer. I'm always lost in thought.   One way to keep on track is to use a timer. I use the Ultrak Jumbo Countdown   Timer, but not as often as I should. I set it for 48 minutes. When it goes off,   it serves as an instant reality check: Am I doing what I'm supposed to be   doing?</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial><STRONG>Do not multitask</STRONG>. Oh, how I love   multitasking. "I'm great at doing many things at once," I told Kris once. She   gave me one of those looks. "No, you're not," she said. "You're great at   starting many things at once, but you never actually do any of them." Ouch! But   she's right. In order for me to get something done, I need to focus my attention   on it. Trying to do several things at once is a sure way to be sure they'll all   be unfinished tomorrow.&nbsp;</FONT></P><STRONG></STRONG>  <P align=left><STRONG><FONT face=Arial></FONT></STRONG></P>  <P><STRONG><FONT face=Arial>Modify your environment to eliminate   distractions</FONT></STRONG></P><FONT face=Arial>.Distractions feed   procrastination. How many of these have you told yourself: "I'll just check   e-mail one more time before I start.","I'll go for a walk after I finish reading   this magazine.","I can paint the house next weekend. I want to watch the   Seahawks game today." </FONT>  <P><FONT face=Arial>Whenever possible, eliminate distractions. Remove clutter   and snack items from your workspace. When working on your computer, only keep   the programs you need open. (Ha! I feel like a hypocrite for advising this ― I   can't even make myself close my e-mail client for five minutes.) Keep your   office tidy. Don't turn on the television unless there's something specific you   intend to watch.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial><STRONG>Compare your actions with your personal   values</STRONG>. Last week I wrote that it doesn't matter what we say is   important to us ― the things that are priorities in our lives are the things we   actually do. How does what you do mesh with what you believe? If you say that   getting out of debt is important to you, are you actually doing the things that   will lead you to get out of debt? If one of your goals is to fit into your old   Levi's, how is watching another episode of <EM>The Office</EM> going to help you   achieve that? Go for a walk!</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial><STRONG>Take back your brain</STRONG>! I've mentioned this   website before in the context of marketing. Its premise is simple: Instead of   letting advertisers persuade you, use marketing techniques to advertise to   yourself. While this is a great way to fight consumer culture, it's also a smart   way to combat procrastination. Create some in-home (or in-office) advertising to   remind you to stop putting things off, to encourage you to do it now.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>Beating procrastination isn't rocket science, but it is   psychology. For many of us, that's just as difficult. It's scary how well this   <EM>Psychology Today</EM> article describes me. If only it gave some tips on how   to move beyond this. Instead it offers one small slice of solace:</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>Procrastinators can change their behavior ― but doing so   consumes a lot of psychic energy. And it doesn't necessarily mean one feels   transformed internally. It can be done with highly structured cognitive   behavioral therapy.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>Can you tell I've been struggling with procrastination   lately? This is something I'll continue to work on. If you have any tips or   stories, I'd love to hear them. Meanwhile, it must be time to read <EM>The War   of Art</EM> again. Maybe I'll do that next week…</FONT></P></DIV></div>
