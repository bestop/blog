  <div class="post"><h2>{{ page.title }}</h2><strong>{{ page.date | date_to_long_string }}</strong><div><DIV>  <DIV class=sanjineiwen>  <P><FONT face=Arial>I was fifteen months old, a happy carefree kid until the day   I fell. It was a bad fall. I landed on a glass rabbit which cut my eye badly   enough to blind it. Trying to save the eye, the doctors stitched the eyeball   together where it was cut, leaving a big ugly scar in the middle of my eye. The   attempt failed, but my mama, in all of her wisdom, found a doctor who knew that   if the eye were removed entirely, my face would grow up badly distorted, so my   scarred, sightless, cloudy and gray eye lived on with me. And as I grew, this   sightless eye in so many ways controlled me.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>I walked with my face looking at the floor so people would   not see the ugly me. Sometimes people, even strangers, asked me embarrassing   questions or made hurtful remarks. When the kids played games, I was always the   "monster." I grew up imagining that everyone looked at me with disdain, as if my   appearance were my fault. I always felt like I was a freak.</FONT></P>  <P align=center><FONT face=Arial></FONT>  <DIV align=left><FONT face=Arial><IMG style="WIDTH: 380px; HEIGHT: 304px"   id=2387918 title="" border=0 alt="Head up high 昂起你的头" align=center   src="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/language_tips/book/attachement/jpg/site1/20100422/0013729e41a90d3a35ad29.jpg"   md5="" sourcedescription="编辑提供的本地文件" sourcename="本地文件"></FONT></DIV>  <P><FONT face=Arial></FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>Yet Mama would say to me, at every turn, "Hold your head up   high and face the world." It became a litany that I relied on. She had started   when I was young. She would hold me in her arms and stroke my hair and say, "If   you hold your head up high, it will be okay, and people will see your beautiful   soul." She continued this message whenever I wanted to hide.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>Those words have meant different things to me over the   years. As a little child, I thought Mama meant, "Be careful or you will fall   down or bump into something because you are not looking." As an adolescent, even   though I tended to look down to hide my shame, I found that sometimes when I   held my head up high and let people know me, they liked me. My mama's words   helped me begin to realize that by letting people look at my face, I let them   recognize the intelligence and beauty behind both eyes even if they couldn't see   it on the surface.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>In high school I was successful both academically and   socially. I was even elected class president, but on the inside I still felt   like a freak. All I really wanted was to look like everyone else. When things   got really bad, I would cry to my mama and she would look at me with loving eyes   and say, "Hold your head up high and face the world. Let them see the beauty   that is inside."</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>When I met the man who became my partner for life, we looked   each other straight in the eye, and he told me I was beautiful inside and out.   He meant it. My mama's love and encouragement were the spark that gave me the   confidence to overcome my own doubt. I had faced adversity, encountered my   problems head on, and learned not only to appreciate myself but to have deep   compassion for others.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>"Hold your head up high," has been heard many times in my   home. Each of my children has felt its invitation. The gift my mama gave me   lives on in another generation.</FONT></P></DIV></DIV></div>
