Mary ran towards me with a   rare bright smile on her face, saying, "I'm gonna have a dance performance   tonight. I hope you'll come. Here is the ticket. Don't forget!" She left in a   hurry, disappearing in the throngs of people quickly.</FONT></DIV>  <DIV class=sanjineiwen>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -1.5pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"What?!   What performance? Dance? Is that credible?" I asked myself. Mary was not such   kind of girl. She was a quite ordinary one. I had never seen her making up or   wearing attractive clothes, moreover, she always wore her big black-frame   glasses, for she did not know how to dress up indeed. What a terrible thing,   especially for a plain girl!</FONT></P>  <P align=right><FONT face=Arial><IMG   style="BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 0px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 0px solid; BORDER-TOP: #000000 0px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 0px solid"   id=3237723 title="" border=0 alt="Crystal shoes of Cinderella 水晶鞋" align=right   src="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/language_tips/book/attachement/jpg/site1/20101011/0013729e41a90e1cc2a92e.jpg"   width=241 height=287 md5="" sourcedescription="编辑提供的本地文件"   sourcename="本地文件"></FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -1.5pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"I should   go to, I must go to. That's a miracle!" I thought.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -1.5pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>I arrived   at the hall with the ticket, and found my seat. Her performance was the seventh   one. I knew I would suffer from a hard time before her turn, for I had no sense   of art, but her performance was worth of watching, no matter how long I would   wait for.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -1.5pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Time went   slowly, I struggled with myself not to fall asleep.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -1.5pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"Let's   welcome the next exciting dance ― Latin!" Applause filled the hall at   once.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -1.5pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>I opened   my eyes as large as possible, fearing to lose anything. Wearing a golden and   shining skirt, Mary appeared on the glorious stage. Her dress went well with the   brilliant lights. Such scene seemed to be a mermaiden showing up under the   glittering sunshine, meanwhile, I could feel all the audience in the hall   focused their eyes on her and it was also hard for me to remove my sights from   her. She was so beautiful: her stature was slim; her long golden hair lay back   in curls over her delicate ears. Dancing with a charming smile, she was fully   absorbed in the Latin music. At this moment, she looked like a pretty butterfly   flying on the splendid stage… I could hardly believe my eyes.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -1.5pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>After all   the performance ended, I waited for her at the gate.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -1.5pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"Hi!" She   stood in front of me with a bag and her crystal high-heeled shoes in her hands,   and dressed as she used to be, but the making-up still could be seen.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -1.5pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"How do   you feel?" There was not a little bit tired expression appeared on her   face.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -1.5pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT   face=Arial>"Fantastic!" I answered.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -1.5pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"Ha, ha. I   knew it would be." She could not conceal her excitement, laughing like a   child.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -1.5pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"May I   lend a hand?"</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -1.5pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"Thank   you!" She handed her crystal shoes to me which were shining in the wonderful   starry night; at the mean time, I realized that every girl has a pair of special   shoes which are like the crystal shoes of   Cinderella.</FONT></P></DIV></DIV></div>
