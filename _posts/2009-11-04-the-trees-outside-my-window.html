  <div><DIV><FONT size=2>  <DIV class=3jbiaoti><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">From the window of my room, I   could see a tall cotton-rose hibiscus. In spring, when green foliage was half   hidden by mist, the tree looked very enchanting dotted with red blossom. This   inspiring neighbor of mine often set my mind working. I gradually regarded it as   my best friend.</FONT></DIV>  <DIV class=3jineiwen>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">Nevertheless, when I   opened the window one morning, to my amazement, the tree was almost bare beyond   recognition as a result of the storm ravages the night before. Struck by the   plight, I was seized with a&nbsp;sadness at the thought "all the blossom is   doomed to fall". I could not help sighing with emotion: the course of life never   runs smooth, for there are so many ups and downs, twists and turns. The   vicissitudes of my life saw my beloved friends parting one after another. Isn't   it similar to the tree shedding its flowers in the wind?</FONT></P>  <P align=left><A   href="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/language_tips/book/attachement/jpg/site1/20070903/0013729e42d20845c38d3f.jpg"   target=_blank><FONT face="Comic Sans MS"></FONT></A></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">This event faded from   my memory as time went by. One day after I came home from the countryside, I   found the room stuffy and casually opened the window. Something outside caught   my eye and dazzled me. It was a plum tree all scarlet with blossom set off   beautifully by the sunset. The surprise discovery overwhelmed me with pleasure.   I wondered why I had no idea of some unyielding life sprouting over the fallen   petals when I was grieving for the hibiscus.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">When the last   withered petal dropped, all the joyful admiration for the hibiscus sank into   oblivion as if nothing was left, until the landscape was again ablaze with the   red plum blossom to remind people of life's alternation and continuance. Can't   it be said that life is actually a symphony, a harmonious composition of loss   and gain.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">Standing by the   window lost in thought for a long time, I realized that no scenery in the world   remains unchanged. As long as you keep your heart basking in the sun, every dawn   will present a fine prospect for you to unfold and the world will always be   about new hopes.</FONT></P></DIV></FONT></DIV></div>
