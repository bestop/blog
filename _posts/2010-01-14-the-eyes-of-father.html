  <div><DIV><FONT face=Arial>Bob Richards, the former pole-vault champion, shares a   moving story about a skinny young boy who loved football with all his heart.   Practice after practice, he eagerly gave everything he had. But being half the   size of the other boys, he got absolutely nowhere. At all the games, this   hopeful athlete sat on the bench and hardly ever played. This teenager lived   alone with his father, and the two of them had a very special relationship.   <BR><BR>Even though the son was always on the bench, his father was always   standing with cheering. He never missed a game. This young man was still the   smallest of the class when he entered high school. But his father continued to   encourage him but also made it very clear that he did not have to play football   if he didn't want to. But the young man loved football and decided to hang in   there. He was determined to try his best at every practice, and perhaps he'd get   to play when he became a senior. <BR><BR>All through high school he never missed   a practice nor a game but remained a bench-warmer all four years. His faithful   father was always in the stands, always with words of encouragement for him.   <BR><BR>When the young man went to college, he decided to try out for the   football team as a "walk-on." Everyone was sure he could never make the cut, but   he did. The coach admitted that he kept him on the roster because he always puts   his heart and soul to every practice, and at the same time, provided the other   members with the spirit and hustle they badly needed. <BR><BR>The news that he   had survived the cut thrilled him so much that he rushed to the nearest phone   and called his father. His father shared his excitement and was sent season   tickets for all the college games. This persistent young athlete never missed   practice during his four years at college, but he never got to play in a game.   <BR><BR>It was the end of his last football season, and as he trotted onto the   practice field shortly before the big playoff game, the coach met him with a   telegram. The young man read the telegram and he became deathly silent.   <BR><BR>Swallowing hard, he mumbled to the coach, "My father died this morning.   Is it all right if I miss practice today?" The coach put his arm gently around   his shoulder and said, "Take the rest of the week off, son. And don't even plan   to come back to the game on Saturday." <BR><BR>Saturday arrived, and the game   was not going well. In the third quarter, when the team was ten points behind, a   silent young man quietly slipped into the empty locker room and put on his   football gear. As he ran onto the sidelines, the coach and his players were   astounded to see their faithful teammate back so soon. "Coach, please let me   play. I've just got to play today." said the young man. The coach pretended not   to hear him. There was no way he wanted the worst player in this close playoff   game. <BR><BR>But the young man persisted, and finally feeling sorry for the   kid, the coach gave in. "All right," he said. "You can go in." Before long, the   coach, the players and everyone in the stands could not believe their eyes. This   little unknown, who had never played before was doing everything right. The   opposing team could not stop him. He ran, he passed, blocked like a star.   <BR><BR>His team began to triumph. The score was soon tied. In the closing   seconds of the game, this kid intercepted a pass and ran all the way for the   winning touchdown. The fans broke loose. His teammates hoisted him onto their   shoulders. Such cheering you never heard. <BR><BR>He looked at the coach, with   tears in his eyes, and said, "Well, you knew my dad died, but did you know that   my dad was blind?" The young man swallowed hard and forced a smile, "Dad came to   all my games, but today was the first time he could see me play, and I wanted to   show him I could do it!" <BR></FONT></DIV></div>
