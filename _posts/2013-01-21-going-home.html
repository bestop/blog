Probably the story is one of those   mysterious bits of folklore that reappear every few year, to be told anew in one form or another. However, I still like to think that it really did happen, somewhere, sometime.<span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:#111111"><br>  <br>  </span><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:宋体;color:#111111;background:white">　　</span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:#111111;background:white">They were going to Fort Lauderdale -- three boys and three   girls -- and when they boarded the bus, they were carrying sandwiches and wine in paper bags, dreaming of golden beaches and sea tides as the gray, cold spring of Now York vanished behind them.</span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:#111111"><br>  </span><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:宋体;color:#111111;background:white">　　</span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:#111111;background:white">As the bus passed through New Jersey, they began to notice   Vingo. He sat in front of them, dressed in a plain, ill-fitting suit, never moving, his dusty face masking his age. He kept chewing the inside of his lip a lot, frozen into complete silence.<span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:#111111"><br>  </span><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:宋体;color:#111111;background:white">　　</span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:#111111;background:white">Deep into the night, outside Washington, the bus pulled   into Howard Johnson's, and everybody got off except Vingo. He sat rooted in his seat, and the young people began to wonder about him, trying to imagine his life: perhaps he was a sea captain, a runaway from his wife, an old soldier going home. When they went   back to the bus, one of the girls sat beside him and introduced herself.<span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:#111111"><br>  </span><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:宋体;color:#111111;background:white">　　</span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:#111111;background:white">&quot;We're going to Florida,&quot; she said brightly. &quot;I hear it's   really beautiful.&quot;<span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:#111111"><br>  </span><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:宋体;color:#111111;background:white">　　</span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:#111111;background:white">&quot;It is,&quot; he said quietly, as if remembering something he   had tried to forget.<span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:#111111"><br>  </span><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:宋体;color:#111111;background:white">　　</span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:#111111;background:white">&quot;Want some wine?&quot; she said.

The girl insisted that he join them. He seemed very shy, and ordered black coffee and smoked nervously as the young people chattered about sleeping on beaches. When they returned to the bus, the girl sat with Vingo again, and after   a while, slowly and painfully, he began go tell his story.

I'd understand. Get a new guy , I said -- she's a wonderful woman, really something   -- and forget about me. I told her she didn't have to write me. And she didn't.
