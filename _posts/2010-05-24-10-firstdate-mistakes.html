  <div><P><FONT face=Arial>The best thing about bad dates is that we walk away with a   great story, and little doubt that the perpetrator is not the person for   us.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>I was thinking about some of the common errors made on first   dates. I came up with 10 common mistakes that could kill the chances for a   second date:</FONT></P>  <P><STRONG><FONT face=Arial>Arriving late</FONT></STRONG></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>Even five minutes of lateness is inexcusable on the first   date. People are already anxious on these excursions, so making someone wait and   think more about everything is pretty rude. Seems like the trend in NYC is to be   late for things regularly. On one date, I texted the girl and told her I was   running late. She said she was too. We ended up just having the date&nbsp;1/2   hour later than planned and technically no one was late because we were   both&nbsp;1/2 hour late together.</FONT></P>  <P><STRONG><FONT face=Arial>Wardrobe malfunction</FONT></STRONG></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>Make sure you cater what you wear to what you're doing. I   try not to make a girl walk too much if she's in heels. Also, I've seen girls   wear pearls and a nice blouse to trashy outdoor drinking events, or heels to   sporting events.</FONT></P>  <P><STRONG><FONT face=Arial>Talking politics or religion</FONT></STRONG></P>  <P align=right><FONT face=Arial><IMG   style="BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 0px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 0px solid; BORDER-TOP: #000000 0px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 0px solid"   id=1815146 title="" border=0 alt=初次约会应避免的10个错误 align=right   src="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/language_tips/book/attachement/jpg/site1/20090914/0013729e41a90c183e5738.jpg"   width=386 height=287 md5="" sourcedescription="编辑提供的本地文件"   sourcename="本地文件"></FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>Staying away from debatable content is a good idea the first   time out. It's fun to argue with your significant other, but I think it's   important to reach a comfort level first. If you try to proselytize someone, or   battle them over a hot topic like abortion, you may reach a point of no   return.</FONT></P>  <P><STRONG><FONT face=Arial>Checking out other people</FONT></STRONG></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>You'd think that no one would do this, but guys are always   looking at waitresses, or other patrons when out.&nbsp;One of my&nbsp;friends   got in hot water because his date told me he made cat calls at other girls while   on a date. Talk about a mistake!</FONT></P>  <P><STRONG><FONT face=Arial>Bringing friends (Non group   date)</FONT></STRONG></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>If you bring friends along you look immature and insecure.   You also throw the other person for a loop if they were expecting the date to be   one-on-one. Make sure you establish that it is a one-on-one date, and follow the   rules and show up alone.</FONT></P>  <P><STRONG><FONT face=Arial>Getting too drunk</FONT></STRONG></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>Some people turn into a completely different person when   they are drunk. Let the other person learn about you while you're sober, before   you get wasted with them. Alcohol should be introduced into the relationship   slowly, but if a drink or two takes the edge off, and wine adds romance it's   fine. Just don't push it too far.</FONT></P>  <P><STRONG><FONT face=Arial>Being too aggressive</FONT></STRONG></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>No one wants to deal with someone's wandering hands before   they are ready. It is one of the best ways to creep someone out. Just because   someone is getting dinner with someone once doesn't mean it's an invitation into   the sack. It's best to be hands off on the first date.</FONT></P>  <P><STRONG><FONT face=Arial>Being too unaggressive</FONT></STRONG></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>My friend Margaret warns me to be more aggressive all the   time. She said that if I don't kiss someone at the end of a date, or make a move   when they hop in my bed they will begin to think something's wrong with them, or   that I'm not into them. Maybe that's true, but sometimes I am just being too   safe so that I don't break the rule I just mentioned above.</FONT></P>  <P><STRONG><FONT face=Arial>Canceling at the last minute or standing someone   up</FONT></STRONG></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>Canceling for a legitimate reason is fine, but respect your   date's time so that they can plan their night without you. Canceling one hour   before a date is not cool ― most of the date prep has already started at this   point. Standing someone up is so rude. What does it accomplish? If you change   your mind, at least have the strength to just cancel. No need to make someone   feel bad and waste their time just because you're too chicken to cancel the   date.</FONT></P>  <P><STRONG><FONT face=Arial>Dominant speaker</FONT></STRONG></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>Try to breathe in between sentences, and don't talk too   much. Give your date a chance to talk. Aren't you trying to get to know one   another? And don't speak for that other person (i.e. order for them at dinner)   unless they invite you to help with their order.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>Do you agree or disagree with any of these? Ever have these   happen to you, or have you ever made these mistakes? Would you go on a second   date after any of these mistakes? What would you add to this list?</FONT></P>  <DIV><FONT face=Arial></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV></div>
