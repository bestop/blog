  <div class="post"><h2>{{ page.title }}</h2><strong>{{ page.date | date_to_long_string }}</strong><div><DIV>  <P><FONT face=Arial>Tucked away in our subconscious is an idyllic vision. We see   ourselves on a long trip that spans the continent. We are traveling by train.   Out of the windows, we drink in the passing scene of cars on nearby highways, of   children waving at a crossing, of cattle grazing on a distant hillside, of smoke   pouring from a power plant, of row upon row of corn and wheat, of flatlands and   valleys, of mountains and rolling hillsides, of city skylines and village   halls.</FONT></P>  <P align=left><FONT face=Arial><IMG style="WIDTH: 300px; HEIGHT: 225px"   id=3973285 title="" border=0 alt=享受现在 align=right   src="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/language_tips/book/attachement/jpg/site1/20110714/0023ae731d750f88d8cb20.jpg"   md5="" sourcedescription="编辑提供的本地文件" sourcename="本地文件"></FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>But uppermost in our minds is the final destination. On a   certain day at a certain hour, we will pull into the station. Bands will be   playing and flags waving. Once we get there, so many wonderful dreams will come   true and the pieces of our lives will fit together like a completed jigsaw   puzzle. How restlessly we pace the aisles, damning the minutes for loitering   --waiting, waiting, waiting for the station.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>"When we reach the station, that will be it!" we   cry.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>"When I'm 18."</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>"When I buy a new 450SL Mercedes Benz!"</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>"When I put the last kid through college."</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>"When I have paid off the mortgage!"</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>"When I get a promotion."</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>"When I reach the age of retirement, I shall live happily   ever after!"</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>Sooner or later, we must realize there is no station, no one   place to arrive at once and for all. The true joy of life is the trip. The   station is only a dream. It constantly outdistances us.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>"Relish the moment "is a good motto, especially when coupled   with <EM>Psalm</EM> 118：24: "This is the day which the Lord hath made; we will   rejoice and be glad in it." It isn't the burdens of today that drive men mad. It   is the regrets over yesterday and the fear of tomorrow. Regret and fear are twin   thieves who rob us of today.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>So stop pacing the aisles and counting the miles. Instead,   climb more mountains, eat more ice cream, go barefoot more often, swim more   rivers, watch more sunsets, laugh more, cry less. Life must be lived as we go   along. The station will come soon enough.</FONT></P></DIV></div>
