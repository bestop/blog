  <div class="post"><h2>{{ page.title }}</h2><strong>{{ page.date | date_to_long_string }}</strong><div><DIV>  <DIV class=sanjineiwen>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Just for today I will try to   live through this day only and not tackle my whole life problem at once. I can   do something for twelve hours that would appall me if I had to keep it up for a   lifetime.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Just for today I will be happy.   This assumes to be true what Abraham Lincoln said, that "Most folks are as happy   as they make up their minds to be."</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Just for today I will adjust   myself to what is, and not try to adjust everything to my own desires. I will   take my "luck" as it comes.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Just for today I will try to   strengthen my mind. I will study. I will learn something useful. I will not be a   mental loafer. I will read something that requires effort, thought and   concentration.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Just for today I will exercise   my soul in three ways. I will do somebody a good turn and not get found out: If   anybody knows of it, it will not count. I will do at least two things I don't   want to do-just for exercise. I will not show anyone that my feelings are hurt:   they may be hurt, but today I will not show it.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Just for today I will be   agreeable. I will look as well as I can, dress becomingly, talk low, act   courteously, criticize not one bit, and try not to improve or regulate anybody   but myself.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Just for today I will have a   program, I may not follow it exactly, but I will have it. I will save myself   from two pests: hurry and indecision.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Just for today I will have a   quiet half hour all by myself and relax. During this half hour, sometime, I will   try to get a better perspective of my life.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Just for today I will be   unafraid. Especially I will not be afraid to enjoy what is beautiful, and to   believe that as I give to the world, so the world will give to   me.</FONT></P></DIV></DIV></div>
