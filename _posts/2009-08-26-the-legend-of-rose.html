  <div><DIV><BR>People have been passionate about roses since the beginning of time. In   fact, it is said that the floors of Cleopatra's palace were carpeted with   delicate rose petals, and that the wise and knowing Confucius had a 600-book   library specifically on how to care for roses.   <P>The rose is a legend on its own. The story goes that during the Roman Empire,   there was an incredibly beautiful maiden named Rhodanthe. Her beauty drew many   zealous suitors who pursued her relentlessly.</P>  <P>Exhausted by their pursuit, Rhodanthe was forced to take refuge from her   suitors in the temple of her friend Diana. Unfortunately, Diana became jealous.   And when the suitors broke down her temple gates to get near their beloved   Rhodanthe, she became angry turning Rhodanthe into a rose and her suitors into   thorns.</P>  <P>In Greek legend, the rose was created by Chloris, the Greek goddess of   flowers. It was just a lifeless seed of a nymph that Chloris found one day in a   clearing in the woods. She asked the help of Aphrodite, the goddess of love, who   gave her beauty Dionysus, the god of wine, added nectar to give her a sweet   scent, and the three Graces gave her charm, brightness and joy.</P>  <P>Then Zephyr, the West Wind, blew away the clouds so that Apollo, the sun god,   could shine and made this flower bloom. And so the Rose was born and was   immediately crowned the Queen of Flowers.</P>  <P>The first true primary red rose seen in Europe was "Slater's Crimson China"   introduced in 1792 from China, where it had been growing wild in the mountains.   Immediately, rose breeders began using it to hybridize red roses for   cultivation.</P>  <P>Ever since, the quest for the perfect red rose has been the Holy Grail6 of   rosarians: a fragrant, disease-resistant, long-lasting, long-stemmed,   reblooming, perfectly formed rose with a clear non-fading vivid red color.   Absolute perfection still hasn't been attained, and of course never will!</P>  <P>There is a special rose language invented as a secret means of communication   between lovers who were not allowed to express their love for one another   openly. In the mid 18th century the wife of the British ambassador in   Constantinople described this in her letters, which were published after her   death.</P>  <P>These letters inspired many books on the language of flowers, each describing   the secret message hidden in each flower. A red rose bud stands for budding   desireï¿½ an open white rose asks "Will you love me?" An open red rose means "I'm   full of love and desire," while an open yellow rose asks "Don't you love me any   more?"<BR></P></DIV></div>
