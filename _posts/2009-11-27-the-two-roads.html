  <div><DIV>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>It was New Year's Night. An   aged man was standing at a window. He raised his mournful eyes towards the deep   blue sky, where the stars were floating like white lilies on the surface of a   clear calm lake. Then he cast them on the earth, where few more hopeless people   than himself now moved towards their certain goal――the tomb. He had already   passed sixty of the stages leading to it, and he had brought from his journey   nothing but errors and remorse. Now his health was poor, his mind vacant, his   heart sorrowful, and his old age short of comforts.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>The days of his youth appeared   like dreams before him, and he recalled the serious moment when his father   placed him at the entrance of the two roads――one leading to a peaceful, sunny   place, covered with flowers, fruits and resounding with soft, sweet songs; the   other leading to a deep, dark cave, which was endless, where poison flowed   instead of water and where devils and poisonous snakes hissed and   crawled.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>He looked towards the sky and   cried painfully, "Oh youth, return! Oh my father, place me once more at the   entrance to life, and I'll choose the better way!" But both his father and the   days of his youth had passed away.</FONT></P>  <P align=left><FONT face=Arial>He was the lights flowing away in the darkness.   These were the days of his wasted life; he saw a star fall from the sky and   disappeared, and this was the symbol of himself. His remorse, which was like a   sharp arrow, struck deeply into his heart. Then he remembered his friends in his   childhood, who entered on life together with him. But they had made their way to   success and were now honoured and happy on this New Year's night.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px" align=left><FONT face=Arial>The clock in the   high church tower struck and the sound made him remember his parents' early love   for him. They had taught him and prayed to God for his good. But he chose the   wrong way. With shame and grief he dared no longer look towards that heaven   where his father live. His darkened eyes were full of tears, and with a   despairing effort, he burst out a cry: "Come back, my early days! Come   back!"</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>And his youth did return, for   all this was only a dream which he had on New Year's Night. He was still young   though his faults were real; he had not yet entered the deep, dark cave, and he   was still free to walk on the road which leads to the peaceful and sunny   land.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Those who still linger on the   entrance of life, hesitating to choose the bright road, remember that when years   are passed and your feet stumble on the dark mountains, you will cry bitterly,   but in vain: "O youth, return! Oh give me back my early   days!"</FONT></P></DIV></div>
