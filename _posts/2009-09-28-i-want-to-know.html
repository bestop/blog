  <div><DIV>  <P><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">It doesn't interest me what you do for a living. I   want to know what you ache for, and if you dare to dream of meeting your heart's   longing.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">It doesn't interest me how old you are. I want to   know if you will risk looking like a fool for love, for your dreams, for the   adventure of being alive.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">It doesn't interest me what planets are squaring   your moon. I want to know if you have touched the center of your own sorrow, and   if you have been opened by life's betrayals or have become shriveled and closed   from fear of further pain.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">I want to know if you can sit with pain, mine or   your own, without moving to hide or fade it or fix it.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">I want to know if you can be with joy, mine or   your own, and if you can dance with wildness and let the ecstasy fill you to the   tips of your fingers and toes without cautioning us to be careful, be realistic,   or to remember the limitations of being a human.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">It doesn't interest me if the story you're telling   me is true. I want to know if you can disappoint another to be true to yourself,   and if you can bear the accusation of betrayal and not betray your own   soul.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">I want to know if you can be faithful and   trustworthy.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">I want to know if you can see the beauty even when   it is not pretty every day, and if you can source your life from its   presence.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">I want to know if your can live with failure,   yours and mine, and still stand on the edge of a lake and shout to the silver of   the full moon "Yes".</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">It doesn't interest me to know where you live, or   how much money you have. I want to know if you can get up after the night of   grief and despair, weary and bruised to the bone, and do what needs to be done   for the children.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">It doesn't interest me who you are, or how you   came to be here. I want to know if you will stand in the center of the fire with   me and not shrink back.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">It doesn't interest me with whom you have studied.   I want to know what sustains you from the inside when all else fails   away.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">I want to know if you can be alone with yourself,   and if you truly like the company you keep in the empty   moments.<BR></FONT></P></DIV></div>
