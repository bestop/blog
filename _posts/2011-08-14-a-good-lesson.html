  <div><DIV>  <DIV class=sanjiriqi><FONT face=Arial>A young man, a student in one of our   universities, was one day taking a walk with a professor, who was commonly   called the students' friend,&nbsp;for his kindness to those who waited on his   instructions. As they went along, they saw lying in the path a pair of old   shoes, which they supposed to belong to a poor man who was employed in a field   close by, and who had nearly finished his day's work.</FONT></DIV>  <DIV class=sanjineiwen>  <P align=right><FONT face=Arial><IMG style="WIDTH: 300px; HEIGHT: 300px"   id=3936037 title="" border=0 alt=难忘的一课 align=right   src="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/language_tips/book/attachement/jpg/site1/20110630/0023ae731d750f76678a3f.jpg"   md5="" sourcedescription="编辑提供的本地文件" sourcename="本地文件"></FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>The student turned to the professor, saying: "Let us play   the man a trick: we will hide his shoes, and conceal ourselves behind those   bushes, and wait to see his perplexity when he cannot find them."</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>"My young friend," answered the professor, "we should never   amuse ourselves at the expense of the poor. But you are rich, and may give   yourself a much greater pleasure by means of the poor man. Put a coin into each   shoe, and then we will hide ourselves and watch how the discovery affects   him."</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>The student did so, and they both placed themselves behind   the bushes close by. The poor man soon finished his work, and came across the   field to the path where he had left his coat and shoes. While putting on his   coat he slipped his foot into one of his shoes; but feeling something hard, he   stooped down to feel what it was, and found the coin. Astonishment and wonder   were seen upon his countenance. He gazed upon the coin, turned it round, and   looked at it again and again. He then looked around him on all sides, but no   person was to be seen. He now put the money into his pocket, and proceeded to   put on the other shoe; but his surprise was doubled on finding the other coin.   His feelings overcame him; he fell upon his knees, looked up to heaven and   uttered aloud a fervent thanksgiving, in which he spoke of his wife, sick and   helpless, and his children without bread, whom the timely bounty, from some   unknown hand, would save from perishing.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>The student stood there deeply affected, and his eyes filled   with tears. "Now," said the professor, "are you not much better pleased than if   you had played your intended trick?"</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>The youth replied, "You have taught me a lesson which I will   never forget. I feel now the truth of those words, which I never understood   before: 'It is more blessed to give than to   receive".</FONT></P></DIV></DIV></div>
