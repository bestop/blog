  <div><p>In 1994 I wrote a letter. I stuck it in an envelope, put it away and completely forgot about it.</p> <p>It wasn&#39;t until we moved into our new home in 2006 that I found it again. It was addressed to me with explicit instructions not to open until my birthday 2005. It was now 2006 so I decided to open it. This is what it said:</p>  <div>Dear Sherri</div> <div>&nbsp;</div> <div>By the time you read this you will be 30. At the age of 18 I had so many hopes and dreams about where you&#39;d be, what you&#39;d be doing and with whom you&#39;d spend your life with.</div> <p>Right now I hope that you have traveled and seen everything you&#39;ve always wanted to, both in Canada and overseas, and maybe even settled down somewhere in Australia doing some research in the field of biology (genetics).</p>  <p>I hope you&#39;re married to the man of your dreams. The man of mine is Gwynn. He is originally from South Africa (another place I wish to visit).</p> <p>You&#39;ll probably have two children of your own &ndash; a girl(Michaela Anne) and a boy (name yet to be decided).</p> <p>If everything goes according to plan you&#39;ll be living in Australia in a big house in a small town outside of a big city with a lot of land, a dog, Gwynn and your two beautiful children. Hopefully you have a career in the medical field, maybe doing research in genetics. Gwynn will be a computer programmer and you will be doing alright for yourselves.</p>  <p>However, if things don&#39;t go according to plan for you, I wish you all the love, happiness and joy in the world and don&#39;t settle for anything less than the best since that is absolutely what you deserve.</p> <p>Live long, be happy and live life to it&#39;s fullest.</p> <p>Love Sherri &quot;18â€³</p> <p>When I read this for the first time since writing it I was floored. Even now having dug this up again another 4 years later I still can&#39;t help but think this is really cool.</p> <p>So much of what I wanted for myself has materialized.</p> <ul> <li>I did travel to a few more places in Canada although I haven&#39;t seen everything I&#39;d like to.  <li>I did marry the man of my dreams and yes he still is my one and only.  <li>I&#39;ve traveled to the UK, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand.  <li>I lived in Australia for nearly 4 years in a big house, in a small suburb, in a major city (close enough).  <li>I had a career in Biology in the field of genetics for 10 years.  <li>I have two lovely kids &ndash; both boys (names now decided).  <li>I have not one dog but two dogs. Both yellow labs from Australia.  <li>Gwynn is a computer programmer.  <li>We are doing okay for ourselves. </li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></ul> <p>After writing this I quickly forgot about what I had put in here actually. The things that materialized were all met with quite a bit of resistance (all internal) but I suppose these were things that I really did want. Having never strayed too far from home overseas travel was a huge deal. Having never been away from my family moving to Australia for several years was an incredibly huge decision.</p>  <p>I find it fascinating how the dreams of a young and naive little girl can become a grown woman&#39;s reality.</p> <p>I&#39;m curious if you guys have ever written anything to your future self and how it stacks up to your current reality. If you haven&#39;t, will you join me in writing a letter now to yourself in say 10 years from now? It&#39;s an interesting little experiment.</p> </div>
