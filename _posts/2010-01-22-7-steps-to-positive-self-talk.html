  <div><DIV>  <DIV class=sanjiriqi><FONT face=Arial>Most of us are in constant mental chatter.   We talk to ourselves all day long and, unfortunately, this self talk is   frequently negative. Often it is tainted with guilt about our past or anxiety   about our future. This negativity can destroy any seed of hope that we may   otherwise have in striving for our dreams.</FONT></DIV>  <DIV class=sanjineiwen>  <P align=center><FONT face=Arial></FONT></P>  <P align=left><FONT face=Arial><IMG style="WIDTH: 243px; HEIGHT: 233px"   id=897775 title="" border=0 alt="7 Steps to Positive Self Talk" align=left   src="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/language_tips/book/attachement/jpg/site1/20080716/0013729e42d209e7ce0d01.jpg"   zmxid="zoomXimageId6" md5="" sourcedescription="编辑提供的本地文件"   sourcename="本地文件"></FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial></FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Our actions are inspired by our   thoughts. If we can change the way we think, we can begin to change the actions   we take. It is human nature to seek personal growth; whether financially,   emotionally, physically or spiritually. Practicing positive self talk can help   us set in motion actions that will bring us greater rewards.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>The following are seven steps   to positive self talk. By following these steps you will begin to rid your inner   conversations of negativity and instead have empowering thoughts.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><STRONG><FONT face=Arial>1. Eliminate Internal   Negative Chatter</FONT></STRONG></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>The first step is one of   awareness. It will be hard to make a change to positive thinking without being   acutely intimate with the thoughts that run through your mind. Recently, I was   amazed to discover deep buried emotions from negative thoughts that I had for   fewer than 10 minutes. Without awareness, I would have carried the hurt and   anger inside. Awareness helped me to bring them out to the open for me to deal   with.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Undoubtedly it will not be easy   to make a switch if you have a long history or negative self talk. Your talk   became negative over the years due to various factors. For instance, if your   first grade teacher repeatedly told you that you were "stupid", you might   believe it to be truly the case. You would find that your inner chatter would   often be filled with talk of "I am so slow" and "it is so hard to learn". If you   constantly tell yourself such negative stories, your actions are going to   reflect your low self esteem. It will be difficult to get very far if you are   always putting yourself down.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>A common negative talk involves   telling yourself "I can't". When you say to yourself "I can't" or "it is too   difficult", you are creating a resistance. Having such a mental block will   prevent you from achieving a task you could otherwise succeed at.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Anytime you catch yourself   saying "I can'...", turn around and challenge your own claim with, "Why can't   I?" Research shows that most geniuses became the people they are also because of   the hard work they put in. So if you would like to be successful, you need to   start saying "I can" a lot more.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>A great method that I have also   found useful is to say "Cancel Cancel" each time I find myself saying something   negative, whether in the mind or verbally. The method works if you sincerely   have the intent of becoming a positive thinker.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><STRONG><FONT face=Arial>2. Positive   Affirmations</FONT></STRONG></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Affirmations are positive   statements of a desired outcome or goal. They are usually short, believable and   focused. By repeating them over and over again, you build inroads into your   subconscious mind, opening up the possibility of a new state of   thoughts.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>An important step when   repeating affirmations is that you need to read your affirmations aloud with   feeling. The mere reading of the words bears no consequence unless you put some   emotions behind them. Of significant fact is that your subconscious mind takes   any orders given in complete faith and after repeated self talk. So the daily   practice of repeating affirmations is important.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Initially you may be skepticism   toward the statement of your positive affirmation. However, if you follow this   simple set of instructions your skepticism will soon give way to a new set of   beliefs and then crystallized into absolute faith.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><STRONG><FONT face=Arial>3. Positive   Scripts</FONT></STRONG></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>One thing that you may observe   is on how easy it is for your mind to build negative thought upon negative   thought. The chatter not only does not stop but it spins a drama that traps and   limits you.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>From now on, regularly do this   exercise instead. Spin an uplifting story that runs like a movie script. Some   visualization will be helpful. You build on a story with a positive outline. The   longer you can tell this story to yourself the better. It is also best if you   can make this story one about having all your goals achieved. When you do this,   you start to internalize your goals and dreams, as if they are something that   you have already achieved.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><STRONG><FONT face=Arial>4. Replace Negative   Influences with positive Ones</FONT></STRONG></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>It is important that you   identify external negative factors in your life which may be holding your   thoughts hostage. For instance, your mental state can become toxic by being   around friends who are negative. If you are not vigilant enough, you will start   to adopt their thoughts as your own. Hence, be alert to what your negative   influences are. If they come from certain friends, limit your exposure to them   as much as you can. Refrain from discussing your plans with people who will be   unsupportive of your dreams and goals.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Instead surround yourself with   thoughts and actions from people who will empower you.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>From being uninspired and   de-motivated, you will begin to feel uplifted and driven to greater self growth.   The positive energy that they vibrate will start affecting the self talk that   you engage in as well.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><STRONG><FONT face=Arial>5. Present Tense   Messages</FONT></STRONG></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>You may find yourself daunted   by the many things you need to do in order to reach your goals. It just seems   overwhelming to become the success that you secretly desire for. Your mind gets   caught up in an endless stream of worry.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>What may be helpful is to   concentrate on steps you can take in the present. If you find yourself becoming   stuck, stop and say, "What can I do right now?" Change your internal talk from a   future anxiety ridden one to one that is about the more manageable present. You   cannot control what will happen in the future but you can take the necessary   steps now that will build a better tomorrow. Taking the necessary steps require   you to focus your thoughts and inner talk on Now.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><STRONG><FONT face=Arial>6. Confront   Fears</FONT></STRONG></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Fear is often what holds you   back from your success. You are scared of taking chances because you fear losing   the security that you enjoy now. You try to convince yourself that you are happy   in your current state when in fact, you are not. Your self talk may sound   positive in your attempt to lie to yourself. But somehow, there is an inner   knowing that you are short changing yourself.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Ask yourself what you are   afraid of. What can be the worst that can happen? Take a step-by-step approach   in breaking down your fears and see if there is any way round to looking at   things more positively. When you confront your fears, you will often realize   that the worst case scenario is not as bad as you think. In fact, the benefits   of change are worth the risk. Your inner talk begins to change at this   point.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><STRONG><FONT face=Arial>7. Focus on Enjoyable   Moments</FONT></STRONG></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>It is much easier to have a   positive attitude if you focus on the enjoyable moments in life rather than the   difficult ones. While there will inevitably be challenges, you need to remember   that life consists of ups and downs and the good times are forged through the   bad.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>So choose to fill your mind   with positive images and thoughts. Make it a conscious habit. Simply bring your   mind back every time it goes astray in its thoughts. For a start, if you can be   grateful for what you have presently, your self talk will also change to be in   alignment with one of joy. A state of gratitude does wonders to your   psyche.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><STRONG><FONT   face=Arial>Conclusion</FONT></STRONG></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Replacing self talk from a   negative to a more positive one is not going to happen overnight. If your mind   has ingrained habits of thinking negatively, it will take some work and time.   However, if you find yourself often struggling, unable to achieve your goals and   talking yourself down, then you should grit your teeth and commit to the process   of change.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>By following the above tips to   positive self talk, you will experience an improvement in the quality of your   life. The rewards are plentiful with greater Happiness, peace and joy. Best of   all, you feel empowered. With the change in energy, you are more likely to reach   your highest potential and achieve success.</FONT></P></DIV></DIV></div>
