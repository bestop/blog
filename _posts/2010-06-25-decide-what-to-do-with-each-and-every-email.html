  <div><div class=Section1>  <p><span lang=EN style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>How many times have you opened, reviewed, and closed the same email message or conversation? Those messages are getting lots of attention but very little action. It is better to handle each email message only once before taking action&#8212;which means you have to decide what to do with it and where to put it. Under the 4 Ds model, you have four choices:<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p style='margin-left:22.5pt;text-indent:-18.0pt;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo2'><![if !supportLists]><span lang=EN style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'><span style='mso-list:Ignore'>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><![endif]><span lang=EN style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>Delete it<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p style='margin-left:22.5pt;text-indent:-18.0pt;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo2'><![if !supportLists]><span lang=EN style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'><span style='mso-list:Ignore'>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><![endif]><span lang=EN style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>Do it<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p style='margin-left:22.5pt;text-indent:-18.0pt;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo2'><![if !supportLists]><span lang=EN style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'><span style='mso-list:Ignore'>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><![endif]><span lang=EN style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>Delegate it<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p style='margin-left:22.5pt;text-indent:-18.0pt;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo2'><![if !supportLists]><span lang=EN style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'><span style='mso-list:Ignore'>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><![endif]><span lang=EN style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>Defer it<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <h3><span lang=EN style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>Delete it <o:p></o:p></span></h3>  <p><span lang=EN style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>Generally, you can delete about half of all the email you get. But some of you shudder when you hear the word &quot;delete.&quot; You're hesitant to delete messages for fear that you might need them at some point. That's understandable, but ask yourself honestly: What percentage of information that you keep do you actually use?<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p><span lang=EN style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>If you do use a large percentage of what you keep, your method is working. But many of us keep a lot more than we use. Here are some questions to ask yourself to help you decide what to delete:<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p style='margin-left:11.25pt;text-indent:-18.0pt;mso-list:l2 level1 lfo4'><![if !supportLists]><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Symbol'><span style='mso-list:Ignore'>&middot;<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><![endif]><span lang=EN style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>Does the message relate to a meaningful objective you're currently working on? If not, you can probably <strong><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>delete it</span></strong>. Why hang on to information that doesn't relate to your main focus? <o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p style='margin-left:11.25pt;text-indent:-18.0pt;mso-list:l2 level1 lfo4'><![if !supportLists]><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Symbol'><span style='mso-list:Ignore'>&middot;<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><![endif]><span lang=EN style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>Does the message contain information you can find elsewhere?

Try it out&#8212;see how much mail you can process in less than two minutes. I think you will be extremely surprised and happy with the results. You could file the message, you could respond to the message, or you could make a phone call. You can probably handle about one-third of your email messages in less than two minutes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <h3><span lang=EN style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>Delegate it <o:p></o:p></span></h3>  <p><span lang=EN style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>If you can't delete it or do it in two minutes or less, can you delegate it?<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p><span lang=EN style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>If you can delegate it, do so right away. You should be able to compose and send the delegating message in about two minutes. After you delegate the action, delete the original message or move it into your email reference system.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <h3><span lang=EN style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>Defer it <o:p></o:p></span></h3>  <p><span lang=EN style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>If you cannot delete it, do it in less than two minutes, or delegate it, the action required is something that only you can accomplish and that will take more than two minutes. Because this is your dedicated email processing time, you need to defer it and deal with it after you are done processing your email. You&#8217;ll probably find that about 20 percent of your email messages have to be deferred.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p><span lang=EN style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>There are two things you can do to defer a message: Turn it into an actionable task, or turn it into an appointment. When you're using Outlook, you can defer emails that require action by dragging the messages to your Task List to turn them into tasks. Name the task to clearly state the required action so that you don't have to reopen the email message. The result is a clearly defined list of actions on your Task List that you can prioritize and schedule to complete on your Calendar. Or you can turn the message into a meeting request by dragging it to your Calendar.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p><strong><span lang=EN style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>Tip</span></strong><span lang=EN style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'> Use the To-Do Bar in Outlook 2010 and Outlook 2007 to drag an email message from an email folder to a date on your Calendar or to your Task List. On the <strong><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"'>View</span></strong> tab, in the Layout group, click the <strong><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>To-Do</span></strong> Bar. When the bar appears, drag the message to your Calendar or to your Task List. This copies the message to the new location; it doesn&#8217;t move it out of the original mail folder, so you&#8217;ll still be able to find what you need.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <h3><span lang=EN style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>Use the 4 Ds model every day<o:p></o:p></span></h3>  <p><span lang=EN style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>Using the 4 Ds model on a daily basis makes it easier to handle a large quantity of email. Our experience shows that, on average, people can process about 100 email messages an hour. If you receive 40 to 100 messages per day, all you need is one hour of uninterrupted email processing time to get through your Inbox. Our statistics show that of the email you receive:<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p style='margin-left:11.25pt;text-indent:-18.0pt;mso-list:l1 level1 lfo6'><![if !supportLists]><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Symbol'><span style='mso-list:Ignore'>&middot;<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><![endif]><span lang=EN style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>50 percent can be deleted or filed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p style='margin-left:11.25pt;text-indent:-18.0pt;mso-list:l1 level1 lfo6'><![if !supportLists]><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Symbol'><span style='mso-list:Ignore'>&middot;<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><![endif]><span lang=EN style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>30 percent can be delegated or completed in less than two minutes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p style='margin-left:11.25pt;text-indent:-18.0pt;mso-list:l1 level1 lfo6'><![if !supportLists]><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Symbol'><span style='mso-list:Ignore'>&middot;<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><![endif]><span lang=EN style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>20 percent can be deferred to your Task List or Calendar to complete later.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p><span lang=EN style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>Of course, if you have a backlog of hundreds of messages, it will take time to get to the point where your daily routine keeps you up to date. It's important to get that backlog down, so I would suggest setting blocks of time aside to work through it. Then, you can really enjoy processing your messages every day using the 4 Ds.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>More: http://www.microsoft.com/atwork/productivity/email.aspx<o:p></o:p></span></p>  </div>  </div>
