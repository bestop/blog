  <div><DIV>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -2.2pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>From my   perspective, once you enter into the realm of marriage, building and maintaining   a successful marriage is actually a big part of personal and financial success.   A solid marriage not only results in people sharing resources together, but a   marriage also provides a lot of emotional support, cheerleading, and   encouragement to succeed.</FONT></P>  <P align=right><FONT face=Arial><IMG   style="BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 0px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 0px solid; BORDER-TOP: #000000 0px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 0px solid"   id=1798921 title="" border=0 alt=幸福婚姻的12个秘诀 align=right   src="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/language_tips/book/attachement/jpg/site1/20090907/0013729e41a90c0ef4563a.jpg"   width=232 height=307 md5="" sourcedescription="编辑提供的本地文件"   sourcename="本地文件"></FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -2.2pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>What   follows are twelve little things I do quite regularly in my marriage. Please,   use as many of these as seem reasonable.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -2.2pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial><STRONG>I   tell my wife I love her every single day.</STRONG> I usually do it in the   morning before she leaves the bedroom, and on weekdays I'll also tell her when I   see her in the evening for the first time. I usually couple it with a kiss. It's   so simple, but it's a constant reminder of the fact that I do love her, no   matter what.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -2.2pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial><STRONG>I   ask about her day, listen, and ask follow up questions.</STRONG> I do this not   only so I can keep tabs on her professional life, but also to give her a great   chance to vent about her situation. Everyone needs to talk about themselves   sometimes to someone who is interested - I try to provide that for her as often   as I can.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -2.2pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial><STRONG>I   try to surprise her on a regular basis.</STRONG> I'll spend an hour preparing a   really excellent supper when she doesn't expect it. I'll spontaneously give the   kids a bath when she's comfortable on the couch under a blanket, even if it's   her turn. Doing these little unexpected things not only shows her I care, but   also often compels her to do similar things for me.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -2.2pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial><STRONG>I   hold her hand. I do this all the time, whenever it crosses my mind and seems   appropriate.</STRONG> I'll just hold her hand gently while we're talking or   we're riding in the car or we're waiting for an appointment or we're sitting on   the couch in the evenings.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -2.2pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial><STRONG>I   talk about EVERYTHING with her and let her determine what's   interesting.</STRONG> If something is concerning me, I don't hide it from her. I   tell her about it. Most of the time she's interested and we'll discuss it -   sometimes she's not and I let it drop (this is key - if she's not into the   topic, I don't push it). Either way, though, she gets the message that I'm   making an effort to share and be open.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -2.2pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial><STRONG>I   work on building a positive relationship with her family.</STRONG> Whenever I   visit or see anyone in her family, I make a special effort to try to establish   or build upon a strong relationship with them. This accomplishes several things:   it makes her more at ease in a family situation, it helps me to build stronger   ties with people that are important to her, and it helps me to understand the   influences that were around her as she grew up.</FONT></P><STRONG></STRONG>  <P align=left><STRONG><FONT face=Arial><IMG   style="BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 0px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 0px solid; BORDER-TOP: #000000 0px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 0px solid"   id=1798922 title="" border=0 alt=幸福婚姻的12个秘诀 align=left   src="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/language_tips/book/attachement/jpg/site1/20090907/0013729e41a90c0ef4653f.jpg"   width=281 height=224 md5="" sourcedescription="编辑提供的本地文件"   sourcename="本地文件"></FONT></STRONG></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -2.2pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><STRONG><FONT face=Arial>I   send her messages during the day.</FONT></STRONG></P><FONT face=Arial>About once   a week, during a time where my wife is really present in my thoughts, I send her   a little simple note by email. All it says is something along the lines of "I   was thinking about you just now. I can't wait until I see you this evening."   It's just a very simple way of letting her know she's on my mind and in my   heart. </FONT>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -2.2pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial><STRONG>I   put careful thought into gifts I give her.</STRONG> Sure, it's easy to just run   out and get a generic gift to cover yourself during an anniversary or a   birthday. However, a gift with some real thought behind it means substantially   more than an obviously off-the-cuff gift.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -2.2pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial><STRONG>I   encourage her to follow her passions and interests, even if they don't inspire   or interest me.</STRONG> If my wife chooses to spend significant time on a   project, it's obviously something that's important to her. That doesn't imply at   all that it has to be important to me. If she's involved in her own project, I   give her positive encouragement and then work on my own interests instead of   saying things like "that seems like a waste of time."</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -2.2pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial><STRONG>If   she needs me, I willingly contribute to those passions.</STRONG> If something   genuinely excites her and she wants me to experience it, I willingly involve   myself in whatever it may be: a particular type of art, a craft project, a yard   project, whatever. Even if I don't enjoy it, I do have the opportunity to learn   more about my wife and what she's passionate about, which means that my   understanding of her grows.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -2.2pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial><STRONG>I   look for opportunities to build mutual friendships.</STRONG> The idea that there   is a group of people that are "my" friends and another group that is "her"   friends can be a big dividing factor between us. Instead, I often focus on   building friendships and relationships that we share with others so that   something of a community of friendship and love grows up around us.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -2.2pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial><STRONG>I   hold her every night, even if it's just for a moment.</STRONG> I might be   completely exhausted when I go to bed in the evening, but I take a moment to   move close to her, put my arm around her, and hold her close, even if it's just   for a minute or so. That moment of physical contact to end the day is a simple   sign of love.</FONT></P></DIV></div>
