I have heard these sons   and daughters say they never fully appreciated their mothers until it was too   late to tell them.</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px; TEXT-INDENT: -1.5pt">I am blessed with the dear   mother who is still alive. I appreciate her more each day. My mother does not   change, but I do. As I grow older and wiser, I realize what an extraordinary   person she is. How sad that I am unable to speak these words in her presence,   but they flow easily from my pen.&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>  <P align=right><IMG id=1325922 title=""   style="BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 0px solid; BORDER-TOP: #000000 0px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 0px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 0px solid"   height=217 alt=为母亲祈祷   src="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/language_tips/book/attachement/jpg/site1/20090508/0013729e41a90b6e134c05.jpg"   width=290 align=right border=0 zmxid="zoomXimageId6" md5=""   sourcedescription="编辑提供的本地文件" sourcename="本地文件"></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px; TEXT-INDENT: -1.5pt">How does a daughter begin   to thank her mother for life itself? For the love, patience and just plain hard   work that go into raising a child? For running after a toddler, for   understanding a moody teenager, for tolerating a college student who knows   everything? For waiting for the day when a daughter realizes her mother really   is?</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px; TEXT-INDENT: -1.5pt">How does a grown woman   thank for a mother for continuing to be a mother? For being ready with   advice(when asked ) or remaining silent when it is most appreciated? For not   saying:"I told you so", when she could have uttered these words dozens of times?   For being essentially herself―loving, thoughtful, patient, and forgiving?</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px; TEXT-INDENT: -1.5pt">I don't know how, dear God,   except to bless her as richly as she deserves and to help me live up to the   example she has set. I pray that I will look as good in the eyes of my children   as my mother looks in mine.&nbsp;</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px; TEXT-INDENT: -1.5pt">A   daughter</P></FONT></DIV></div>
