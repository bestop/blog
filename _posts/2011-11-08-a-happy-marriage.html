  <div><DIV>  <P><FONT face=Arial>A man and his girlfriend were married. It was a large   celebration.</FONT></P>  <P align=right><FONT face=Arial><IMG style="WIDTH: 280px; HEIGHT: 383px"   id=4096959 title="" border=0 alt=幸福的婚姻 align=right   src="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/language_tips/book/attachement/jpg/site1/20110830/0023ae731d750fc6c97504.jpg"   md5="" sourcedescription="编辑提供的本地文件" sourcename="本地文件"></FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>All of their friends and family came to see the lovely   ceremony and to partake of the festivities and celebrations. All had a wonderful   time. The bride was gorgeous in her white wedding gown and the groom was very   dashing in his black tuxedo. Everyone could tell that the love they had for each   other was true.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>A few months later, the wife came to the husband with a   proposal, "I read in a magazine, a while ago, about how we can strengthen our   marriage," she offered. "Each of us will write a list of the things that we find   a bit annoying with the other person. Then, we can talk about how we can fix   them together and make our lives happier together."</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>The husband agreed. So each of them went to a separate room   in the house and thought of the things that annoyed them about the other. They   thought about this question for the rest of the day and wrote down what they   came up with. The next morning, at the breakfast table, they decided that they   would go over their lists.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>"I'll start," offered the wife. She took out her list. It   had many items on it, enough to fill&nbsp;three pages. In fact, as she started   reading the list of the little annoyances, she noticed that tears were starting   to appear in her husband's eyes.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>"What's wrong?" she asked. "Nothing," the husband replied,   "keep reading your list."</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>The wife continued to read until she had read all three   pages to her husband. She neatly placed her list on the table and folded her   hands over the top of it.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>"Now, you read your list and then we'll talk about the   things on both of our lists," she said happily.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>Quietly the husband stated, "I don't have anything on my   list. I think that you are perfect the way that you are. I don't want you to   change anything for me. You are lovely and wonderful and I wouldn't want to try   and change anything about you." The wife, touched by his honesty and the depth   of his love for her and his acceptance of her, turned her head and   wept.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>In life, there are enough times when we are disappointed,   depressed and annoyed. We don't really have to go looking for them. We have a   wonderful world that is full of beauty, light and promise. Why waste time in   this world looking for the bad, disappointing or annoying when we can look   around us, and see the wondrous things before us?</FONT></P></DIV></div>
