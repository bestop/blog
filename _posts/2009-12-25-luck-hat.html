Good stuff is always happening to him. Do you believe in luck? And if   so, how can I get more of it?</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>―Looking for   luck in Louisiana</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Dear   Looking,</FONT></P>  <P align=right><FONT face=Arial><IMG style="WIDTH: 252px; HEIGHT: 297px"   id=1899152 title="" border=0 alt="Luck hat 幸运帽" align=right   src="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/language_tips/book/attachement/jpg/site1/20091022/0013729e41a90c4a44221a.jpg"   zmxid="zoomXimageId6" md5="" sourcedescription="编辑提供的本地文件"   sourcename="本地文件"></FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>I was eating   breakfast with one hand, petting my cat, Cow, with the other, and reading the   back of the cereal box, when―"YOUCH!" I screamed. "Why'd you pinch   me?"</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"You're not   wearing green," said my little brother, Tex. "Everyone knows you get pinched if   you don't wear green on Saint Patrick's Day!"</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"It's true,"   said my little sister, Indi.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>I was mostly   mad about getting pinched, but also a tiny bit glad about being reminded that it   was Saint Patrick's Day.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>I panicked.   "What am I going to do? I don't have time to change. I'll get pinched all day   long!"</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"Well," Tex   said, taking the old green baseball cap off his head, "you could borrow my lucky   hat."</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"But it's   your favorite!" I said.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"I know,"   said Tex. "Just promise to give it back after school."</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"No problem,"   I said, glancing in the mirror on my way out the door. "I look like a goofball   in this thing!"</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"A lucky   goofball!" said Tex.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"Humm." I   grabbed my backpack. "Thanks, I think."</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Now, before I   go on, you should know that I'm not an overly superstitious person. I don't   believe that thirteen is an unlucky number or that breaking a mirror brings   seven years of bad luck.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>I definitely   don't freak out if a black cat crosses my path. And when it comes to things like   lucky four-leaf clovers and lucky pennies, I just never believed in   them.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Anyway, I was   racing to catch the school bus, and I saw a dollar on the sidewalk! I looked   around to see if anyone was looking for it, but people just kept stepping on the   poor thing, so I decided to rescue it. I'd found pennies and nickels before, but   never a dollar!</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Then, I   didn't miss the bus, because the bus was even later than me――which never   happens!</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>My luck   didn't stop there. Carlos and Jackson were sitting behind me, quizzing each   other on spelling words. I turned around and said, "You guys know that test   isn't till tomorrow, right?"</FONT></P>  <P align=left><FONT face=Arial><IMG   style="BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 0px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 0px solid; BORDER-TOP: #000000 0px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 0px solid"   id=1899183 title="" border=0 alt="Luck hat 幸运帽" align=left   src="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/language_tips/book/attachement/jpg/site1/20091022/0013729e41a90c4a446b1d.jpg"   width=306 height=306 zmxid="zoomXimageId7" md5="" sourcedescription="编辑提供的本地文件"   sourcename="本地文件"></FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"It got   switched to this morning," said Jackson. "Remember? There's some assembly   tomorrow."</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"That's   right-I totally forgot!" I said. "I'm so lucky that I sat in front of you. If I   hadn't , I wouldn't have found out till it was too late!"</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>I got out my   spelling words, studied all the way to school. And ended up acing the   test!</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>The minute I   got home, I gave Tex a gigantic hug.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"This is the   luckiest hat in the world," I said. "I'm never taking it off!"</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"But you   promised to give it back!" said Tex.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"I know,   but…" I pretended to try to pull the hat off my head. "I think it's   stuck."</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"It is not!"   said Tex.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT   face=Arial>"Please-oh-please let me borrow your lucky hat for one more day!" I   begged. "Tomorrow I'm auditioning for the school play, and I need every bit of   help I can get."</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"OK," said   Tex. "One more day. But you'd better be really nice to me."</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"I will," I   agreed. "In fact-here you can have my lucky dollar!"</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Tex let out a   whoop, then started dancing around and waving his gift in the air.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>The next day   turned out to be super lucky. My audition couldn't have gone better.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"Wow,   Arizona!" said my friend Mareya. "I can't believe how amazingly you just did!   You are so getting a major part in this play!"</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"Thanks! You   did really great, too!" I said. "But honestly, the only reason I did OK is   because I had my lucky hat."</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"What lucky   hat?" asked Mareya.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"This one," I   said, reaching into my backpack, where I thought I'd put Tex's hat since I   couldn't wear it for the audition. But it wasn't there! "Oh no!" I cried. "It's   gone! What am I going to tell Tex?"</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Mareya helped   me look for it. Luckily, we found Tex's hat in my locker. Also luckily, I   discovered that I could be lucky with or without a goofy-looking cap in my   possession.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"So it wasn't   the hat," said Mareya. "This is just a wild guess, but maybe it was all those   hours you spent practicing over the past month."</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"Hmm," I   said. "It's possible."</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>So, dear   Looking, I guess you could say that luck is a combination of being prepared,   believing in yourself, … and maybe just a tiny bit of magic! In other words,   luck may come your way, but you have to be ready for it when it does!</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Ciao for   now</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT   face=Arial>Arizona</FONT></P></DIV></div>
