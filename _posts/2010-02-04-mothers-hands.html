  <div><P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Night after night, she came to   tuck me in, even long after my childhood years. Following her longstanding   custom, she'd lean down and push my long hair out of the way, then kiss my   forehead.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>I don't remember when it first   started annoying me ― her hands pushing my hair that way. But it did annoy me,   for they felt work-worn and rough against my young skin. Finally, one night, I   shouted out at her, "Don't do that anymore ―your hands are too rough!" She   didn't say anything in reply. But never again did my mother close out my day   with that familiar expression of her love.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Time after time, with the   passing years, my thoughts returned to that night. By then I missed my mother's   hands, missed her goodnight kiss on my forehead. Sometimes the incident seemed   very close, sometimes far away. But always it lurked, in the back of my   mind.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Well, the years have passed,   and I'm not a little girl anymore. Mom is in her mid-seventies, and those hands   I once thought to be so rough are still doing things for me and my family. She's   been our doctor, reaching into a medicine cabinet for the remedy to calm a young   girl's stomach or soothe the boy's scraped knee. She cooks the best fried   chicken in the world... gets stains out of blue jeans like I never   could...</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Now, my own children are grown   and gone. Mom no longer has Dad, and on special occasions, I find myself drawn   next door to spend the night with her. So it was late on Thanksgiving Eve, as I   slept in the bedroom of my youth, a familiar hand hesitantly run across my face   to brush the hair from my forehead. Then a kiss, ever so gently, touched my   brow.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>In my memory, for the   thousandth time, I recalled the night my young voice complained, "Don't do that   anymore ― your hands are too rough!" Catching Mom's hand in hand, I blurted out   how sorry I was for that night. I thought she'd remember, as I did. But Mom   didn't know what I was talking about. She had forgotten ― and forgiven ― long   ago.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>That night, I fell asleep with   a new appreciation for my gentle mother and her caring hands. And the guilt that   I had carried around for so long was nowhere to be found.</FONT></P>  <DIV><FONT size=2 face=Arial></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV></div>
