  <div><DIV>  <DIV class=sanjineiwen>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Yes this may be surprising, I   was only 13 years old that time. But, don't know how or why it happened to me so   early. I fell deeply in love with a guy, who I used to think was annoying 2   months ago.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>It was 1997, in Chittagong,   Bang- ladesh, me and my family have just moved to a new apartment in a new area.   So, after few weeks have passed, I started going back to school, since it was   during Ramadan we moved. Well, I made some new friends in the neighborhood. This   girl who was always hanging out with, her name was Ivy.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>One day when I was going to   school, I bumped into Ivy on the way out of my building, and she was standing   next to this guy, he lived in the building right beside mine. He said "Hi" to   me, and we just asked each other "how are you" and blah blah, then I had to   leave. But I noticed that guy was looking at me. It was a different kind of   look, look with love in his eyes. Few days later, I noticed whenever I go to   school and come back from school, he is standing in his balcony, and smiling at   me. If he is not around, and one of his friends see me, they start to yell out   his name. Oh yeah, by the way, his name was Mamun.</FONT></P>  <P align=center><FONT face=Arial></FONT></P>  <P align=right><FONT face=Arial><IMG style="WIDTH: 120px; HEIGHT: 120px"   id=1081894 title="" border=0 alt="My Very First Love 我的初恋" align=right   src="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/language_tips/book/attachement/jpg/site1/20081118/0013729e42d20a8cb1ba16.jpg"   zmxid="zoomXimageId6" md5="" sourcedescription="编辑提供的本地文件"   sourcename="本地文件"></FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial></FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>So, I was very annoyed by those   things. And I even told Ivy to tell Mamun to stop these foolishness. After my   exams were over, I had a break. So I used to go to the roof and read books to   spend my time. Mamun used to come to their roof also and both roofs where so   close to each other that you can just jump from one to another.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Once I was reading a book, and   I noticed Mamun come to their roof and he looked at me, and smiled. OH MY GOD! I   don't know what happened to me. That sweet smile just took me away. I smiled   back at him, for the first time. I could never forget that moment. We used to   smile at each other whenever we saw each other, but never had a chat. I was sure   that he liked me a lot, because, anytime he would see me on the roof from his   balcony, he came up to the roof right away. I fell in love with him very deeply.   I was surprised that I did. The feelings I had was so beautiful and made me so   happy.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Mamun did come to my roof one   day to talk to me but I wanted him to go away. I didn't want any one to see us   talking. As you know, in Bangladesh rumors go around so fast. When we talked, I   saw deep love in his eyes. I always smiled at him; I didn't talk to him much.   Still, life was going on so wonderfully. Mamun never told me he loved me. I   thought that was because, I was 5/6 years younger than him.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Very soon, I found out that me   and my family are leaving Bang- ladesh and coming to Canada. I was devas- tated.   I cried all night but there was nothing to do. When Mamun found out, he asked me   on the roof, if it was true. When I said yes, he asked how long will I be in   Canada. The answer was maybe forever, we were going to settle in Canada. He   looked depressed, all he said was "Oh", then I told him our flight   date.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>The next month, it was Ramadan   again. Mamun came to say good bye to me on the roof, he was leaving to spend his   Eid with his family. That day, I was so sad, I felt like I lost something very   important in my life. We said goodbye to each other, he said he thinks I am such   a sweet girl, he hopes I have a great life in Canada. Oh my god, I couldn't hold   myself, I think my eyes became watery. I didn't want him to see that I was   crying. I said "you too" and tried to smile and left the roof right   away.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>That was the last day I ever   saw my first love. Now 4 years later, here I am in CANADA. I have guy in my life   now, whom I am deeply love with after Mamun. I never lose him.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>I am ... over Mamun now.   Everytime I remember those days, looking at each other on the roof, talking, I   feel really down. I wonder where he is now, if we will even meet again... I can   never forget my first love.</FONT></P></DIV></DIV></div>
