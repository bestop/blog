He is strikingly handsome with his classic Californian good looks and a   smile that could melt butter, and I am probably at my physical peak, with wavy   brown hair, bright blue eyes, and curves that could stop traffic.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Neither of   us knew what to expect. After meeting on a humanitarian aid trip in Central   America, there was clearly a connection between us that we had neither time nor   opportunity to explore. The fact that he moved to Europe the day after our   return left us to continue building our relationship online through email and   chat.</FONT></P>  <P align=center><FONT face=Arial></FONT>  <CENTER><FONT face=Arial><IMG   style="BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 0px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 0px solid; BORDER-TOP: #000000 0px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 0px solid"   id=1955557 title="" border=0 alt="Just friends 只是朋友" align=center   src="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/language_tips/book/attachement/jpg/site1/20091112/0013729e41a90c65c49f1f.jpg"   width=269 height=299 md5="" sourcedescription="编辑提供的本地文件"   sourcename="本地文件"></FONT></CENTER>  <P><FONT face=Arial></FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>So as I   flew across the Atlantic to visit him during my vacation, the possibilities ran   wildly through my head. Friends at home had inundated me with notions that Paris   is the city of love, and we would be fools not to be swept away. Pessimism   reared its head, too, taunting that I didn't really know this man, and for all I   knew he was actually a monstrous human being I would be stranded with for a   week.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>However,   from the time I stepped off of the metro and jumped into his arms until the   moment we tearfully said goodbyes at the same station, all speculation was   forgotten and the natural flow of "us" prevailed.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>There were   no impassioned kisses or nights of passion. But there were hours of conversation   under the glow of the Eiffel Tower. Barrels of laughter over inside jokes that   will never makes sense to anyone but us. Tears over the deepest secrets and   pains of our hearts. Comfortable silences that can only happen in the peace of   trust. Speculation over the future, our dreams and fears. Confession of our   fears and failures. And reassurances that we see each other beyond the facade   and to the truth.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>And as I   returned to anxious friends waiting to hear stories of scandalous Parisian   rendezvous, there seemed to be some hint of disappointment. No excitement, no   scandal, no drama. As though I had missed out on something.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Although   our relationship did not progress or digress as I imagined or feared, I couldn't   have written a more perfect story. No, I didn't walk away with a lover, but I   now have a friend who is dear to my heart. Who I shared an amazing week with,   who holds many of my precious memories, and who knows me and loves me. How could   I hope for more?</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>One moment   that resonates with me is of my last night in Paris.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Exhausted   from a full week and dreading my departure the next morning, we collapsed onto   the bed and looked at each other. His bright blue eyes softly pierced mine with   a reassuring knowledge that he knew me, and I knew him, and this was good. As we   lay there, I knew that this was right, and what was meant to grow between us   had.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"Just   friends" is not a disappointment. Sometimes it's exactly what you   need.</FONT></P></DIV></DIV></div>
