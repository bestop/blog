  <div><DIV><FONT size=2>  <DIV class=sanjineiwen>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px">He met her at a party. She   was so outstanding, many guys chasing after her, while he was so normal, nobody   paid attention to him.</P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px">At the end of the party, he   invited her to have coffee with him, she was surprised but due to being polite,   she promised. They sat in a nice coffee shop, he was too nervous to say   anything, she felt uncomfortable, and she thought to herself, "Please, let me go   home..."</P>  <P align=right><IMG   style="BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 0px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 0px solid; BORDER-TOP: #000000 0px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 0px solid"   id=2443717 title="" border=0 alt="The salty coffee 咸味咖啡" align=right   src="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/language_tips/book/attachement/jpg/site1/20100513/0013729e41a90d55f6b103.jpg"   width=241 height=323 md5="" sourcedescription="编辑提供的本地文件" sourcename="本地文件"></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px">Suddenly he asked the   waiter, "Would you please give me some salt? I'd like to put it in my coffee."   Everybody stared at him, so strange! His face turned red but still, he put the   salt in his coffee and drank it. She asked him curiously, "Why you have this   hobby?" He replied, "When I was a little boy, I lived near the sea, I liked   playing in the sea, I could feel the taste of the sea, just like the taste of   the salty coffee. Now every time I have the salty coffee, I always think of my   childhood, think of my hometown, I miss my hometown so much, I miss my parents   who are still living there." While saying that tears filled his eyes. She was   deeply touched. That's his true feeling, from the bottom of his heart. A man who   can tell out his homesickness, he must be a man who loves home, cares about   home, has responsibility of home... Then she also started to speak, spoke about   her faraway hometown, her childhood, her family.</P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px">That was a really nice   talk, also a beautiful beginning of their story. They continued to date. She   found that actually he was a man who meets all her demands; he had tolerance,   was kind hearted, warm, careful. He was such a good person but she almost missed   him! Thanks to his salty coffee! Then the story was just like every beautiful   love story, the princess married to the prince, and then they were living the   happy life... And, every time she made coffee for him, she put some salt in the   coffee, as she knew that's the way he liked it.</P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px">After 40 years, he passed   away, left her a letter which said, "My dearest, please forgive me, forgive my   whole life's lie. This was the only lie I said to you － the salty coffee.   Remember the first time we dated? I was so nervous at that time, actually I   wanted some sugar, but I said salt. It was hard for me to change so I just went   ahead. I never thought that could be the start of our communication! I tried to   tell you the truth many times in my life, but I was too afraid to do that, as I   have promised not to lie to you for anything... Now I'm dying, I'm afraid of   nothing so I tell you the truth, I don't like the salty coffee, what a strange   bad taste... But I have had the salty coffee for my whole life! Since I knew   you, I never feel sorry for anything I do for you. Having you with me is my   biggest happiness for my whole life. If I can live for the second time, still   want to know you and have you for my whole life, even though I have to drink the   salty coffee again."</P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px">Her tears made the letter   totally wet. Someday, someone asked her, "What's the taste of salty coffee?" She   replied, "It's sweet."</P></DIV></FONT></DIV></div>
