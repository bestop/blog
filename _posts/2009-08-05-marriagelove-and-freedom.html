  <div><DIV><FONT size=2>You are asking, "Is it possible to be married and to be   free?"</FONT></DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV><FONT size=2>If you take marriage non-seriously, then you can be free. If   you take it seriously, then freedom is impossible. Take marriage just as a game   -- it is a game. Have a little sense of humor, that it is a role you are playing   on the stage of life; but it is not something that belongs to existence or has   any reality -- it is a fiction.</FONT></DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV><FONT size=2>But people are so stupid that they even start taking fiction   for reality. I have seen people reading fiction with tears in their eyes,   because in the fiction things are going so tragically. It is a very good device   in the movies that they put the lights off, so everybody can enjoy the movie,   laugh, cry, be sad, be happy.</FONT></DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV><FONT size=2>If there was light it would be a little difficult -- what will   others think? And they know perfectly well that the screen is empty -- there is   nobody; it is just a projected picture. But they forget it   completely.</FONT></DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV><FONT size=2>And the same has happened with our lives. Many things which   are simply to be taken humorously, we take so seriously -- and from that   seriousness begins our problem.</FONT></DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV><FONT size=2>In the first place, why should you get married? You love   someone, live with someone -- it is part of your basic rights. You can live with   someone, you can love someone.</FONT></DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV><FONT size=2>Marriage is not something that happens in heaven, it happens   here, through the crafty priests. But if you want to join the game with society   and don't want to stand alone and aloof, you make it clear to your wife or to   your husband that this marriage is just a game:</FONT></DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV><FONT size=2>"Never take it seriously. I will remain as independent as I   was before marriage, and you will remain as independent as you were before   marriage. Neither I am going to interfere in your life, nor are you going to   interfere in my life; we will live as two friends together, sharing our joys,   sharing our freedom -- but not becoming a burden on each other.</FONT></DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV><FONT size=2>And any moment we feel that the spring has passed, the   honeymoon is over, we will be sincere enough not to go on pretending, but to say   to each other that we loved much -- and we will remain grateful to each other   forever, and the days of love will haunt us in our memories, in our dreams, as   golden -- but the spring is over.</FONT></DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV><FONT size=2>Our paths have come to a point, where although it is sad, we   have to part, because now, living together is not a sign of love. If I love you,   I will leave you the moment I see my love has become a misery to you. If you   love me, you will leave me the moment you see that your love is creating an   imprisonment for me."</FONT></DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV><FONT size=2>Love is the highest value in life: It should not be reduced to   stupid rituals. And love and freedom go together -- you cannot choose one and   leave the other. A man who knows freedom is full of love, and a man who knows   love is always willing to give freedom.</FONT></DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV><FONT size=2>If you cannot give freedom to the person you love, to whom can   you give freedom? Giving freedom is nothing but trusting. Freedom is an   expression of love.</FONT></DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV><FONT size=2>So whether you are married or not, remember, all marriages are   fake -- just social conveniences. Their purpose is not to imprison you and bind   you to each other; their purpose is to help you to grow with each other. But   growth needs freedom; and in the past, all the cultures have forgotten that   without freedom, love dies.</FONT></DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV><FONT size=2>You see a bird on the wing in the sun, in the sky, and it   looks so beautiful. Attracted by its beauty, you can catch the bird and put it   in a golden cage.</FONT></DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV><FONT size=2>Do you think it is the same bird? Superficially, yes, it is   the same bird who was flying in the sky; but deep down it is not the same bird   -- because where is its sky, where is its freedom?</FONT></DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV><FONT size=2>This golden cage may be valuable to you; it is not valuable to   the bird. For the bird, to be free in the sky is the only valuable thing in   life. And the same is true about human beings.</FONT></DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV><FONT size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV></div>
