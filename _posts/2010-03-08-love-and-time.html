  <div><DIV>  <DIV class=sanjineiwen>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Once upon a time, there was an   island where all the feelings lived: Happiness, Sadness, Knowledge, and all of   the others, including Love. One day it was announced to the feelings that the   island would sink, so all constructed boats and left. Except for   Love.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Love was the only one who   stayed. Love wanted to hold out until the last possible moment.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>When the island had almost   sunk, Love decided to ask for help.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Richness was passing by Love in   a grand boat. Love said,</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"Richness, can you take me with   you?"</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Richness answered, "No, I   can't. There is a lot of gold and silver in my boat. There is no place here for   you."</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Love decided to ask Vanity who   was also passing by in a beautiful vessel. "Vanity, please help me!"</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"I can't help you, Love. You   are all wet and might damage my boat," Vanity answered.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Sadness was close by so Love   asked, "Sadness, let me go with you."</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"Oh . . . Love, I am so sad   that I need to be by myself!"</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Happiness passed by Love, too,   but she was so happy that she did not even hear when Love called her.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Suddenly, there was a voice,   "Come, Love, I will take you." It was an elder. So blessed and overjoyed, Love   even forgot to ask the elder where they were going. When they arrived at dry   land, the elder went her own way. Realizing how much was owed the elder, Love   asked Knowledge, another elder, "Who Helped me?"</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"It was Time," Knowledge   answered.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"Time?" asked Love. "But why   did Time help me?"</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Knowledge smiled with deep   wisdom and answered, "Because only Time is capable of understanding how valuable   Love is."</FONT></P></DIV></DIV></div>
