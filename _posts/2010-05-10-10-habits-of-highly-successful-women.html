  <div><DIV>  <P><FONT face=Arial>These 10 habits of highly successful women range from   maintaining your hormonal balance to letting go of the past -- and they will   positively affect your mind, body, and soul.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>First, check out this quotation from writer Anais   Nin:</FONT></P>  <P><EM><FONT face=Arial>"Dreams pass into the reality of action. From the action   stems the dream again; and this interdependence produces the highest form of   living."</FONT></EM></P>  <P align=right><FONT face=Arial><IMG   style="BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 0px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 0px solid; BORDER-TOP: #000000 0px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 0px solid"   id=1783084 title="" border=0 alt=成功女性的十个好习惯 align=right   src="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/language_tips/book/attachement/jpg/site1/20090831/0013729e41a90c05c1b50c.jpg"   width=315 height=315 md5="" sourcedescription="编辑提供的本地文件"   sourcename="本地文件"></FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>Taking action is a crucial habit of successful women…and so   is dreaming! Don't let go of your passions...</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>1. Maintain your hormonal balance. Are you moody, exhausted,   irritable, or sad? Check your hormones. If they're out of whack, then you'll   struggle to be successful! Make sure you're getting enough protein and vitamins,   and decrease your refined sugars and carbohydrates.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>2. Forgive yourself for your mistakes. Highly successful   women don't obsess or feel guilty about past choices or failures. They make   mistakes, move on, and apply what they've learned to new situations.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>3. Connect with who you are. Being a daughter, wife, or   mother is one aspect of your life. It doesn't define who you are as a woman. To   connect with who you are, find and express your authentic self. The more   authentic you are, the more appealing you'll be to others � and to   yourself!</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>4. Avoid energy vampires. Do you feel drained or sad after   spending time with a particular friend, coworker, or relative? Limit the time   you spend with him or her. Note how you feel after visiting with a certain   person; if you feel energized and happy, then you're in good company. Highly   successful women choose their companions wisely.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>5. Speak kindly to yourself! If you beat yourself up for   being overweight, a "bad" mom, or not exercising enough, you just create a   downward spiral. Highly successful women remind themselves of their achievements   and successes. They refuse to tell themselves negative things; they accept   themselves.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>6. Listen to your body. I heard Oprah Winfrey say this about   10 years ago: listen to what your body is telling you. Are you emotionally   hungry or physically hungry? Feed yourself properly. Are you sad, furious, or   depressed? Follow your body's cues.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>7. Volunteer your time. Find something that takes you out of   your comfort zone or that you love to do. You'll feel great that you're helping   others out � and volunteering directly improves your physical health. Highly   successful women step out of their comfort zones and takes risks.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>8. Let go of perfectionism. Strive to do your best, but let   go of perfectionist tendencies. Accepting that you're doing the best you can is   a habit of highly successful women. Letting go of perfectionism is vitamins and   exercise for the soul!</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>9. Use your core strengths. Are you a natural mathematician,   writer, or party planner? Discover your core strengths by trying different   things until you find what fits. To take risks and try new things, take   short-term volunteer positions or volunteer for new projects at work or in your   community.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>10. Take time for yourself. This habit for highly successful   women is my favorite: take time to recharge your batteries and refuel your   emotional, spiritual, and physical energy. Spend at least a few minutes alone   each day � even if you have to lock yourself in the bathroom to do   it!</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>Have a missed a habit of highly successful women � or do you   have any comments on any of the above?
