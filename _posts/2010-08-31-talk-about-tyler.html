  <div><DIV class=sanjineiwen>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>In my dual   profession as an educator and health care provider, I have worked with numerous   children infected with the virus that causes AIDS. The relationships that I have   had with these special kids have been gifts in my life. They have taught me so   many things, but I have especially learned that great courage can be found in   the smallest of packages. Let me tell you about Tyler.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Tyler was   born infected with HIV: his mother was also infected. From the very beginning of   his life, he was dependent on medications to enable him to survive. When he was   five, he had a tube surgically inserted in a vein in his chest. This tube was   connected to a pump, which he carried in a small backpack on his back.   Medications were hooked up to this pump and were continuously supplied through   this tube to his bloodstream. At times, he also needed supplemented oxygen to   support his breathing.</FONT></P>  <P align=center><FONT face=Arial></FONT>  <DIV align=left><FONT face=Arial><IMG   style="BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 0px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 0px solid; BORDER-TOP: #000000 0px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 0px solid"   id=2180357 title="" border=0 alt=天堂里的红衣服 align=center   src="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/language_tips/book/attachement/jpg/site1/20100128/0013729e41a90ccb331705.jpg"   width=363 height=323 md5="" sourcedescription="编辑提供的本地文件"   sourcename="本地文件"></FONT></DIV>  <P><FONT face=Arial></FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Tyler   wasn't willing to give up one single moment of his childhood to this deadly   disease. It was not unusual to find him playing and racing around his backyard,   wearing his medicine-laden backpack and dragging his tank of oxygen behind him   in his little wagon. All of us who knew Tyler marveled at his pure joy in being   alive and the energy it gave him. Tyler's mom often teased him by telling him   that he moved so fast she needed to dress him in red. That way, when she peered   through the window to check on him playing in the yard, she could quickly spot   him.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>This   dreaded disease eventually wore down even the likes of a little dynamo like   Tyler. He grew quite ill and, unfortunately, so did his HIV-infected mother.   When it became apparent that he wasn't going to survive, Tyler's mom talked to   him about death. She comforted him by telling Tyler that she was dying too, and   that she would be with him soon in heaven.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>A few days   before his death, Tyler beckoned me over to his hospital bed and whispered, "I   might die soon. I'm not scared. When I die, please dress me in red. Mom promised   she's coming to heaven, too. I'll be playing when she gets there, and I want to   make sure she can find me."</FONT></P></DIV>  <DIV><FONT size=2 face=Arial></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV></div>
