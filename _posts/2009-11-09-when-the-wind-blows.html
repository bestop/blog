He constantly advertised for hired hands. Most people were               reluctant to work on farms along the Atlantic. They dreaded the               awful storms that raged across the Atlantic，wreaking havoc on the               buildings and crops. As the farmer interviewed applicants for the               job，he received a steady stream of refusals.</DIV>              <DIV class=3jineiwen>              <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px">Finally，a short，thin man，well past               middle age，approached the farmer. "Are you a good farmhand？"the               farmer asked him.</P>              <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px">"Well，I can sleep when the wind               blows，" answered the little man.</P>              <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px">Although puzzled by this answer，the               farmer，desperate for help，hired him. The little man worked well               around the farm，busy from dawn to dusk，and the farmer felt satisfied               with the man s work.</P>              <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px">Then one night the wind howled               loudly in from offshore. Jumping out of bed，the farmer grabbed a               lantern and rushed next door to the hired hand s sleeping quarters.               He shook the little man and yelled，"Get up！ A storm is coming！ Tie               things down before they blow away！"</P>              <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px">The little man rolled over in bed               and said firmly，"No sir. I told you，I can sleep when the wind               blows."</P>              <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px">Enraged by the response，the farmer               was tempted to fire him on the spot. Instead，he hurried outside to               prepare for the storm. To his amazement，he discovered that all of               the haystacks had been covered with tarpaulins. The cows were in the               barn，the chickens were in the coops，and the doors were barred. The               shutters were tightly secured. Everything was tied down. Nothing               could blow away.</P>              <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px">The farmer then understood what his               hired hand meant，so he returned to his bed to also sleep while the               wind blew.</P>              <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px">MORAL： When you re               prepared，spiritually，mentally，and physically，you have nothing to               fear.</P></DIV></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></FONT></DIV></div>
