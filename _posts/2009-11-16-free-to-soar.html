  <div><DIV>  <DIV class=3jbiaoti><FONT size=2 face=Arial>One windy spring day, I observed   young people having fun using the wind to fly their kites. Multicolored   creations of varying shapes and sizes filled the skies like beautiful birds   darting and dancing. As the strong winds gusted against the kites, a string kept   them in check.</FONT></DIV>  <DIV class=3jineiwen>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT size=2 face=Arial>Instead of blowing away   with the wind, they arose against it to achieve great heights. They shook and   pulled, but the restraining string and the cumbersome tail kept them in tow,   facing upward and against the wind. As the kites struggled and kept them in tow,   facing upward and against the wind. As the kites struggled and trembled against   the string, they seemed to say," Let me go! Let me go! I want to be free!" they   soared beautifully even as they fought the restriction of the string. Finally,   one of the kites succeeded in breaking loose. "Free at last," it seemed to say.   "Free to fly with the wind."</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT size=2 face=Arial>Yet freedom from   restraint simply put it at the mercy of an unsympathetic breeze. It fluttered   ungracefully to the ground and landed in a tangled mass of weeds and string   against a dead bush. "Free at last", free to lie powerless in the dirt, to be   blown helplessly along the ground, and to lodge lifeless against the first   obstruction.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT size=2 face=Arial>How much like kites we   sometimes are. The heaven gives us adversity and restrictions, rules to follow   from which we can grow and gain strength. Restraint is a necessary counterpart   to the winds of opposition. Some of us tug at the rules so hard that we never   soar to reach the heights we might have obtained. We keep part of the   commandment and never rise high enough to get our tails off the   ground.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT size=2 face=Arial>Let us each rise to the   great heights, recognizing that some of the restraints that we may chafe under   are actually the steadying force that helps us ascend and   achieve.</FONT></P></DIV></DIV></div>
