Love and fear are opposite emotional attitudes that shape our life in   very different ways. The psychoanalyst John McMurray describes the difference   like this:</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"The fear-determined have no   sun in themselves and go about putting out the sun in other people. The   love-determined have life in them, abundant life. They are the people who are   really alive, of whom it can be said that they possess eternal life as a well   within them perpetually."</FONT></P>  <P align=left><FONT face=Arial><IMG style="WIDTH: 234px; HEIGHT: 252px"   id=875435 title="" border=0 alt="7 Steps Toward Love" align=left   src="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/language_tips/book/attachement/jpg/site1/20080630/0013729e42d209d2e78608.jpg"   md5="" sourcedescription="编辑提供的本地文件" sourcename="本地文件"></FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial></FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Life is a lot more beautiful   and vivid if it is determined by love and not by fear. I'm sure you can imagine   that someone determined completely by love would be a kind of saint. In   contrast, most of us ordinary human beings are determined by both forces, love   and fear. However, in my experience, even a tiny shift towards love―and away   from fear―can bring a lot more Happiness.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Here are 7 tips that you can   move towards love and away from fear.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>1. Cultivate   gratitude</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Gratitude makes us feel   happier. If you remember to be grateful for the blessings of your life, you   start to feel more connected to yourself and others. When you let go of niggles   and embrace gratitude instead, love springs up.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>2. Reality-test your   fear</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Sometimes fear can be like a   cloud that keeps out the sunlight. Then everything feels huge and oppressive. A   simple way to deal with fear is to test its reality. Write down three things   that you are afraid of. Then look at each point and ask yourself, "Is this fear   really grounded in reality?" I know that when I do this, I often find that my   fears are unfounded. It's like living in a shadow-land, peering into the future   and expecting bad things to happen.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>3. Take action</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Fear is often born out of   inaction. For example, if you get a sense that your health is impaired, but you   don't check it out with a doctor, you may start to imagine that you are heading   for a major health crisis. (I could fill a whole notebook with illnesses I once   thought I had - but never actually got!) Once you've been to a doctor and   reviewed the problems, the steps towards renewed health may seem much more   manageable.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Taking action is the best   antidote to fear. Once you start to address the issues one by one, fears shrink   and may even disappear.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>4. Cultivate   friendships</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Good friends are important   because they teach us to love. It's often much easier to love a good friend than   it is to love and forgive our partner. Friends are lasting companions in life.   It's good to talk with them when we feel afraid. They can give us a fresh   perspective on what is troubling us.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>5. Be generous</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>In the quote above, John   McMurray points out that fear-determined people have no sun in themselves and   "go about putting out the sun in other people." Fear makes us narrow-minded and   we tend to put down others. Here is how I deal with that: when I notice I'm   getting negative, I put a small pebble into one of my pockets. Each time I catch   myself using a put-down, I quietly shift the pebble into the other pocket and   say to myself kindly, "Well, maybe I can say that differently next   time."</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>6. Practise kindness</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Kindness is 'love-in-action'.   It's good to make a habit of it. The trick is to notice what people need. Here   is an example: yesterday I was talking to a stall-holder at a farmers' market   who fashions wooden spoons. He saw that I was carrying a bag of luscious, fresh   corncobs. He said, "Oh, they look nice!" Then he sighed, "Oh well, by the time   I've finished selling at my stand they'll have all gone." I offered to get some   for him. It was a small action but it made us both feel good. Try and spot one   occasion each day when you can be of help.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>7. Open your   awareness</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Fear tends to make us focus   inwards. A way out of is to do the opposite and open your awareness to include   everything around you. For example, if you notice anxious thoughts, open you   mind and listen to sounds around you. Maybe you can hear birdsong, or traffic   noise, or children playing. This has an instant calming effect and fear   wanes.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>If you follow these 7 tips,   you'll move towards more love and less fear in your life. Soon you will notice   an upsurge of Happiness and contentment, instead of fear and anxiety.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>What is your experience of   living with love or with fear? Maybe you could share your special way of   inviting love into your life and saying "good-bye" to   fear?</FONT></P></DIV></DIV></div>
