  <div><DIV><FONT face=Arial>&nbsp;I like to visit the cemetery and look at different   tombstones. I like to find out what is the last phrase that people like to put   in their tombstones. It always gives me a lot of inspirations. <BR><BR>On day, I   walked into a cemetery aimlessly looking at different tombstones. There have a   lot of fancy carved stones engraved with famous proverbs. Some have beautiful   sculptures, some big and some small. <BR><BR>Suddenly, I saw a tombstone; no   fancy carving, no beautiful sculpture, not big, just an ordinary stone. On the   stone, it said: <BR><BR>1964 to 1984<BR>Getter Edge <BR><BR>In the middle of the   stone, it had a big word carved......"IF" and under this word it said "I have   another chance". <BR><BR>I stood there, don't know for how long, looked at the   big word "IF" and the little words "I have another chance". A lot of thoughts   went though my mind. <BR><BR>I asked myself, "If I have another chance, what   will I do?!!" <BR><BR>Friends, if you have another chance, what will you do?   Will you treasure the chance that you have or will you wait until your tombstone   says: <BR></FONT>  <P><FONT face=Arial>"IF"<BR>"I have another chance"   </FONT></P></DIV></div>
