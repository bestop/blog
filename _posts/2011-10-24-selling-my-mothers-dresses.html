  <div><DIV>  <DIV class=sanjiriqi><FONT face=Arial>I like to think that a bit of her   laughter, sense of wonder and fun travels with them and that any tears or   sadness are long since washed away.</FONT></DIV>  <DIV class=sanjineiwen>  <P><FONT face=Arial>I moved from Chicago to Brooklyn in July of 2004, just in   time to watch my mother die. That wasn't why I moved back. She was supposed to   be getting better; the chemo was working. I came because I'd rented an apartment   with Jay, this cute guy I'd started dating, who was originally from New York   too. But a week after pulling up in a U-Haul, I found myself cleaning out my   childhood home with my siblings. Our parents were both gone now; anything that   we couldn't take with us had to fit in a 20-cubic-yard Dumpster.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>I could barely squeeze the little I saved into the   one-bedroom Jay and I shared. I didn't even try to unpack the boxes of my   parents' books, the bags of my mom's dresses. Jay (who held me up at the funeral   and painted our place all my favorite colors and quickly proved to be much more   than just a cute guy) had to shimmy sideways to get between my father's easy   chair and my mother's broken desk. I was claustrophobic from the mountains of   photos and misplaced knickknacks, and yet I found myself drawn to someone else's   castoffs. We hadn't lived there more than a month and already I was   claustrophobic from the mountains of photos and misplaced knickknacks. So it   made no sense when, out walking one Saturday later that summer, something caught   my eye ― a pale green scrap of fabric ― and suddenly I was steering Jay toward   someone else's castoffs. My first stoop sale.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>Laid out on the pavement was a batik scarf with dangling   earrings, glass candle-holders, a small wooden jewelry box, books from Heidegger   to Nora Ephron, a videotape of "Risky Business." Draped on the wrought iron   fence behind: a tan knit shawl, a few pairs of jeans, a green cotton dress with   buttons that looked like the inside of a seashell. I'd never owned anything   green, but I had to feel those buttons between my fingers, the cotton so thin it   was maybe two washes away from disintegration.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>"You can try it on if you want. There's a mirror over by the   tree."</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>I looked up to find her face. I'd inspected all of her   things without even saying hello.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>I saw a smile that was working hard. Her skin was pale; her   shoulders thin and her hair cut very short. Or was it new peach fuzz, just   growing in?</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>I was at once embarrassed and humbled. I'd thought people   who hosted stoop sales just had too many clothes or were looking to cash in on   some scratched records. But there was something else happening here. This woman   looked like she was getting rid of a past she didn't need or want. A dress that   was too big for her. A chest of drawers that took up too much space, space she   needed, maybe, to heal or grow.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>"Thanks," I whispered. I wasn't planning on buying anything   really, but now I needed to, to show her that I appreciated her things and would   give them a safe home. I paid her 20 bucks for her green dress, her wooden   jewelry box and her blue candle-holder.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>From that day on, I became devoted to stoop sales. Some of   my favorite things ― including the sundress I'm wearing today and the Winnie the   Pooh car that Jay is pushing our daughter in ― are from someone else's life. I   find no joy in shopping at regular stores anymore. I've been known to break down   in cranky tears by the checkout of Ikea. I'd love to say I'm trying to speak out   against sweatshop conditions or conserve thread. But it's much more selfish than   that. I love trying to sniff out a memory from a bud vase or a favorite song   from a case of L.P.'s. The stains and broken switches, the bend in the knee of   an old pair of jeans. Sometimes I just want to look at how many Mason jars one   person can collect and imagine what they might've held. It's comforting to know   that someone has breathed and laughed inside a sweater before me. That I am part   of a continuum.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>I have great respect for people who organize stoop sales. It   must be an emotional way to spend your weekend. Arranging your history on a card   table so strangers can snoop and evaluate. There's also a certain freedom and   recklessness to putting a price tag on an ex's mix CD or "The Marx-Engels   Reader" you never read in college and are finally ready to admit you never   will.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>I am very big on purging my own things. Every few weeks I   drop off a load of clothes at the resale shop around the corner or cart a stack   of books to the curb. The more I read about Buddhism while the stock market dips   and flips, the more I feel like I have to practice non-attachment. Maybe it has   to do with losing my parents at a young age. Maybe I can't bond with anyone or   anything without also seeing us eventually separated. Whatever the cause, I know   that once I love a scarf or shirt too dearly, it needs to find a new home. Even   that green dress ― which I turned into a blouse after deciding it made me look   like a celery stalk ― is long gone by now.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>The one thing I haven't been able to do is manage my own   stoop sale. I've come close. A few weeks ago, I carried the last of my mother's   dresses to a friend's stoop. These were Mom's best items ― strong taffetas and   feathered collars, cream brocade and lavender chiffon. My mother was elegant,   whether she was in a tailored suit or her limp blue bathrobe. I tried to remind   myself of this as I watched, from the park across the way, for hours, those   dresses wilt on the cement stair. The sidewalks were crowded with iced coffees   and farmers' market gladioluses. Nobody even glanced at my mother's   finery.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>"C'mon," I finally said to my 2-year-old daughter. I pulled   her out of the swings. "I'm going to show you Grandma Joanie's   dresses."</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>Grandma Joanie is just a name to my daughter. Even when I   show her pictures, there is no perfumed hug or ice cream afternoon to make her a   real person. And those dresses were equally meaningless to her. Empty pieces of   hot fabric that were once worn by the most important person in my life. For all   my hours with Thich Nhat Hanh's teachings on letting go, I still hold on tightly   sometimes, whether I want to or not. I still think her stuff is as sacred as her   memory.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>I did not buy back my mother's things.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>I did not pick up her skirt that was dusting the   sidewalk.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>Instead, I bought a new/used raincoat for $10, put my   daughter on my shoulders, and walked us a new route   home.</FONT></P></DIV></DIV></div>
