  <div class="post"><h2>{{ page.title }}</h2><strong>{{ page.date | date_to_long_string }}</strong><div><DIV>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>A farmer had some puppies he   needed to sell. He painted a sign advertising the pups and set about nailing it   to a post on the edge of his yard. As he was driving the last nail into the   post, he felt a tug on his overalls. He looked down into the eyes of a little   boy.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"Mister," he said, "I want to   buy one of your puppies."</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"Well," said the farmer, as he   rubbed the sweat off the back of his neck, "these puppies come from fine parents   and cost a good deal of money."</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>The boy dropped his head for a   moment. Then reaching deep into his pocket, he pulled out a handful of change   and held it up to the farmer. "I've got thirty-nine cents. Is that enough to   take a look?"</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"Sure," said the   farmer.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>And with that he let out a   whistle, "Here, Dolly!" he called.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Out from the doghouse and down   the ramp ran Dolly followed by four little balls of fur. The little boy pressed   his face against the chain link fence. His eyes danced with delight.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>As the dogs made their way to   the fence, the little boy noticed something else stirring inside the doghouse.   Slowly another little ball appeared; this One noticeably smaller. Down the ramp   it slid. Then in a somewhat awkward manner the little pup began hobbling toward   the others, doing its best to catch up...</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"I want that one," the little   boy said, pointing to the runt.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>The farmer knelt down at the   boy's side and said, "Son, you don't want that puppy. He will never be able to   run and play with you like these other dogs would."</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>With that the little boy   stepped back from the fence, reached down, and began rolling up one leg of his   trousers. In doing so he revealed a steel brace running down both sides of his   leg attaching itself to a specially made shoe. Looking back up at the farmer, he   said, "You see sir, I don't run too well myself, and he will need someone who   understands."</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>The world is full of people who   need someone who understands.</FONT></P></DIV></div>
