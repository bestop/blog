  <div class="post"><h2>{{ page.title }}</h2><strong>{{ page.date | date_to_long_string }}</strong><div><DIV><FONT size=2>  <DIV class=3jbiaoti><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">The Single's Day is just around   the corner. In China, Valentine's Day is overrated and has a reputation for   being exclusively for couples. But what about the single gal or guy? In that day   single people often feel lonely and even worthless. There must be a way they can   celebrate their day even without a partner. That's why the Single's Day came   about. We should look at it as nothing more than an excuse to treat ourselves to   one or a few indulgences.</FONT></DIV>  <DIV class=3jineiwen>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">I came up with some   suggestions on how "single" men and women could spend the day alone, but not   necessarily lonely. Instead of passing The Single's Day off as a completely   invaluable waste of space on the calendar, try one, several or all of the   following esteem-boosters to lift your single spirit this time   around.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">1. The recently   single gal/guy. First and foremost, do not ever call your ex in case you get   lonely. Exes belong to the past. Move on.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face="Comic Sans MS"></FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, you must still   be hurting and are going through the healing process. But remember this famous   line from a song: "Ooh child, things are gonna be easier." In time you are   indeed going to be OK. Don't sulk. The Single's Day can be a day to spend with   family.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">You can even make it   more creative by suggesting potluck and maybe plan some board games or videoke.   During this time, family can offer you the most solid support you will need, so   take advantage of it.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">2. The still-single   guy or gal. Some of you may be getting restless already because it's been years   and you're still without a partner. Relax. Why don't you call your other single   pals and plan a night out? Have a nice dinner and go to a singles bar afterward.   You'll never know who you might meet. There is always a big chance you will meet   someone interesting and single too. The Single's Day is also for people looking   for love.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">3. Otherwise, for the   groom-to-be, you can plan a bachelor party or fraternity party.You plan every   aspect including bachelor party ideas, games, party favors, drinks and food for   your bachelor party or fraternity party (frat party). Since a lot goes into   planning the bachelor party, it's will be tricky, fun but also stressful. Make   it a very memorable one, why not enjoy it?</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">4. Buy yourself your   favorite flowers. Who says you have to wait around for Prince/Princess Charming   to add some spice and color to your dorm or apartment with your preferred plant   life? Both guys and girls enjoy the occasional bouquet of Birds of Paradise or a   lucky bamboo tree to boost Feng Shui. <IMG style="WIDTH: 120px; HEIGHT: 120px"   id=630871 title="" border=0 hspace=5 vspace=5 align=right   src="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/language_tips/book/attachement/jpg/site1/20071112/0013729e42d208a2445408.jpg"   zmxid="zoomXimageId7" md5="" sourcedescription="编辑提供的本地文件"   sourcename="本地文件"></FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">5. The single mom/dad   (formerly married or not). Take your kid/s out on a date. Why not? You can even   plan an all-day activity. Go to the mall, take him to his favorite pizza place,   watch a movie or treat him to play-all-you-can (with a reasonable budget) games   at a carnival. It could be anything. Time spent with your kids is always   worthwhile.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">Do as you please.   Ultimately, you know what can make you happy. That's the most important   thing.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">Who says romance is   dead? Believe it: Love is in the air! Choose what you like，trust your family and   friends.</FONT></P></DIV></FONT></DIV></div>
