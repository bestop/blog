As other men sometimes tabulate lists of   properties they own or would like to own, I set down my inventory of earthly   desirables: health, love, beauty, talent, power,riches,and fame.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>When my   inventory was completed I proudly showed it to a wise elder who had been the   mentor and spiritual model of my youth. Perhaps I was trying to impress him with   my precocious wisdom. Anyway, I handed him the list. "This", I told him   confidently, "is the sum of mortal goods. Could a man possess them all, he would   be as a god."</FONT></P>  <P align=center><FONT face=Arial></FONT>  <CENTER><FONT face=Arial><IMG style="WIDTH: 343px; HEIGHT: 274px" id=1726435   title="" border=0 alt="On peace of mind 心如止水" align=center   src="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/language_tips/book/attachement/jpg/site1/20090810/0013729e41a90be9d5cf02.jpg"   zmxid="zoomXimageId6" md5="" sourcedescription="编辑提供的本地文件"   sourcename="本地文件"></FONT></CENTER>  <P><FONT face=Arial></FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>At the   corners of my friend's old eyes, I saw wrinkles of amusement gathering in a   patient net. "An excellent list," he said, pondering it thoughtfully, "well   digested in contented and set down in not-unresonable order. But it appears, my   young friend, that you have omitted the most important element of all. You have   forgotten the one ingredient, lacking which each possession becomes a hideous   torment."</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"And   what." I asked, peppering my voice with truculence, "is that missing   ingredient?"</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"With a   pencil stub he crossed out my entire schedule. Then, haveing demolished my   adolscent dream structure at a single stroke, he wrote down three syllables:   peace of mind. "This is the gift that God reserves for His special Proteges." he   said.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"Talent   and beauty He gives to many. Wealth is commonplace, fame not rare. But peace of   mind - that is His final guerdon of approval, the fondest insignia of His love,   He bestows it charily. Most men are never blessed with it; others wait all their   lives- yes, far into advanced age - for this gift to descend upon   them."</FONT></P></DIV></DIV></div>
