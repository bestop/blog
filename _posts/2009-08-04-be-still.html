description:   我明白，我们的社会说，一切都要行动，停滞就代表懒惰、消极以及无收益。而那些我们被迫停下来的时刻，比如排队、等医生或者在乘坐公交车，我们往往会感到不自在，往往想找些事儿干。一些人拿着手机按来按去，一些人会处理文件或者读一些东西，还有些人只是坐立不安的呆在那儿。貌似我们都不太习惯"停顿"。  <P   style="

Feel your breath coming in and going out. Listen to your thoughts. See the   details of your surroundings.</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px; TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt">Be at peace with being   still.</P>  <P align=right><IMG id=1703228 title=""   style="BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 0px solid; BORDER-TOP: #000000 0px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 0px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 0px solid"   height=399 alt="Be still 片刻停留，片刻自我"   src="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/language_tips/book/attachement/jpg/site1/20090803/0013729e41a90be0a4af19.jpg"   width=295 align=right border=0 zmxid="zoomXimageId6" md5=""   sourcedescription="编辑提供的本地文件" sourcename="本地文件"></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px; TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt">In this modern world,   activity and movement are the default modes, if not with our bodies then at   least with our minds, with our attention. We rush around all day, doing things,   talking, emailing, sending and reading messages, clicking from browser tab to   the next, one link to the next.</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px; TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt">We are always on, always   connected, always thinking, always talking. There is no time for stillness ― and   sitting in front of a frenetic computer all day, and then in front of the   hyperactive television, doesn't count as stillness.</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px; TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt">This comes at a cost: we   lose that time for contemplation, for observing and listening. We lose   peace.</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px; TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt">And worse yet: all the   rushing around is often counterproductive. I know, in our society action is   all-important ― inaction is seen as lazy and passive and unproductive. However,   sometimes too much action is worse than no action at all. You can run around   crazily, all sound and fury, but get nothing done. Or you can get a lot done ―   but nothing important. Or you can hurt things with your actions, make things   worse than if you'd stayed still.</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px; TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt">And when we are forced to   be still ― because we're in line for something, or waiting at a doctor's   appointment, or on a bus or train ― we often get antsy, and need to find   something to do. Some of us will have our mobile devices, others will have a   notebook or folder with things to do or read, others will fidget. Being still   isn't something we're used to.</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px; TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt">Take a moment to think   about how you spend your days ― at work, after work, getting ready for work,   evenings and weekends. Are you constantly rushing around? Are you constantly   reading and answering messages, checking on the news and the latest stream of   information? Are you always trying to Get Lots of Things Done, ticking off tasks   from your list like a machine, rushing through your schedule?</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px; TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt">Is this how you want to   spend your life?</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px; TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt">If so, peace be with you.   If not, take a moment to be still. Don't think about what you have to do, or   what you've done already. Just be in the moment.</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px; TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt">Then after a minute or two   of doing that, contemplate your life, and how you'd like it to be. See your life   with less movement, less doing, less rushing. See it with more stillness, more   contemplation, more peace.</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px; TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt">Then be that vision.</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px; TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt">It's pretty simple,   actually: all you have to do is sit still for a little bit each day. Once you've   gotten used to that, try doing less each day. Breathe when you feel yourself   moving too fast. Slow down. Be present. Find happiness now, in this moment,   instead of waiting for it.</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px; TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt">Savor the stillness. It's a   treasure, and it's available to us, always.</P></DIV></div>
