  <div><DIV><FONT size=2>  <P>What is the secret ingredient of tough people that enables them to succeed?   Why do they survive the tough times when others are overcome by them? Why do   they win when others lose? Why do they soar when others sink?</P>  <P>The answer is very simple. It's all in how they perceive their problems. Yes,   every living person has problems. A problem-free life is an illusion-a mirage in   the desert. Accept that fact.</P>  <P>Every mountain has a peak. Every valley has its low point. Life has its ups   and downs, its peaks and its valleys. No one is up all the time, nor are they   down all the time. Problems do end. They are all resolved in time.</P>  <P>You may not be able to control the times, but you can compose your response.   You can turn your pain into profanity -or into poetry. The choice is up to you.   You may not have chosen your tough time, but you can choose how you will react   to it.</P>  <P>For instance, what is the positive reaction to a terrible financial setback?   In this situation would it be the positive reaction to copout and runaway?   Escape through alcohol, drug, or suicide? No! Such negative reactions only   produce greater problems by promising a temporary solution to the pressing   problem.</P>  <P>The positive solution to a problem may require courage to initiate it. When   you control your reaction to the seemingly uncontrollable problem of life, then   in fact you do control the problem's effect on you. Your reaction to the problem   is the last word! That's the bottom line. What will you let this problem do to   you? It can make you tender or tough. It can make you better or bitter. It all   depends on you.</P>  <P>In the final analysis, the tough people who survive the tough times do so   because they've chosen to react positively to their predicament. Tough times   never last, but tough people do. Tough people stick it out. History teaches us   that every problem has a lifespan.</P>  <P>No problem is permanent. Storms always give way to the sun. Winter always   thaws into springtime. Your storm will pass. Your winter will thaw. Your problem   will be solved.</P></FONT></DIV></div>
