  <div><DIV>  <DIV class=sanjineiwen>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Michael is   the kind of guy you love to hate. He is always in a good mood and always has   something positive to say. When someone would ask him how he was doing, he would   reply, "If I were any better, I'd be twins!" He was a natural   motivator.</FONT></P>  <P align=left><FONT face=Arial><IMG   style="BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 0px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 0px solid; BORDER-TOP: #000000 0px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 0px solid"   id=1242276 title="" border=0 alt="Life is about choices 幸福可以选择" align=left   src="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/language_tips/book/attachement/gif/site1/20090316/0013729e41a90b28470c1b.gif"   width=353 height=268 zmxid="zoomXimageId6" md5="" sourcedescription="编辑提供的本地文件"   sourcename="本地文件"></FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>If an   employee was having a bad day, Michael was there telling the employee how to   look on the positive side of the situation. Seeing this style really made me   curious, so one day I went up to Michael and asked him, "I don' t get it. You   can' t be positive all the time. How do you do it?"</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Michael   replied, each morning I wake up and say to myself 'Mike, you have two choices   today. You can choose to be in a good mood or you can choose to be in a bad   mood.' I choose to be in a good mood. Each time something bad happens, I can   choose to be a victim or choose to learn from it. I choose to learn from it.   Every time someone comes to me complaining I can choose to accept their   complaining or I can point out the positive side of life. I choose the positive   side of life."</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"Yeah,   right. It isn't that easy." I protested.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"Yes it is,   " Michael said. "Life is all about choices. When you cut away all the junk,   every situation is a choice. You choose how you react to situations. You choose   how people will affect your mood. You choose to be in a good mood or bad mood.   The bottom line is: It's your choice how you live life. " I reflected on what   Michael said.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Soon   thereafter, I left the big enterprise that I had worked in for years to start my   own business. We lost touch, but I often though about him when I made a choice   about life instead of reacting to it. Several years later, I heard Michael was   involved in a serious accident, falling off 60 feet from a communications   tower.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>After l8   hours of surgery, and weeks of intensive care, Michael was released from the   hospital with rods placed in his back. I saw Michael about six months after the   accident. When I asked him how he was, he replied, "If I were any better, I'd be   twins. Wanna see my scars?" I declined to see his wounds, but did ask him what   had gone through his mind as the accident took place.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"The first   thing that went through my mind was the well being of my soon-to-born daughter,"   Michael replied. "Then, as I lay on the ground, remembered I had two choices: I   could choose to live or I could choose to die. I chose to live." "Weren't you   scared? Did you lose consciousness?" I asked. Michael continued, "... the   paramedics were great. They kept telling me I was going to be fine. But when   they wheeled me into the operation room and I saw the expressions on the faces   of the doctors and nurses, I got really scared. In their eyes, l read 'He's a   dead man.' I knew I needed to take action." "What did you do?" I asked. "Well,   there was a big burly nurse shouting questions at me" said Michael. "She asked   me if I was allergic to anything. 'Yes,' I said. The doctors and nurses stopped   working as they waited for my reply. I took a deep breath and yelled",   'Gravity'" Over their laughter, I told them, 'I'm choosing to live. Operate on   me as if I am alive, not dead'."</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Michael   lived, thanks to the skill of his doctors, but also because of his amazing   attitude.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>I learned   from him that every day we have a choice to live fully. Attitude is   everything.</FONT></P></DIV></DIV></div>
