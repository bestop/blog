  <div><DIV>  <DIV class=sanjineiwen>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Time is   running out for my friend. While we are sitting at lunch she casually mentions   she and her husband are thinking of starting a family. "We're taking a   survey,"she says, half-joking. "Do you think I should have a baby?"</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"It will   change your life," I say, carefully keeping my tone neutral. "I know,"she says,   "no more sleeping in on weekends, no more spontaneous holidays..."</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>But that's   not what I mean at all. I look at my friend, trying to decide what to tell her.   I want her to know what she will never learn in childbirth classes. I want to   tell her that the physical wounds of child bearing will heal, but becoming a   mother will leave her with an emotional wound so raw that she will be vulnerable   forever.</FONT></P>  <P align=right><FONT face=Arial><IMG   style="BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 0px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 0px solid; BORDER-TOP: #000000 0px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 0px solid"   id=1247762 title="" border=0 alt="You'll never regret it 母爱的真谛" align=right   src="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/language_tips/book/attachement/jpg/site1/20090319/0013729e41a90b2c35dd0e.jpg"   width=235 height=252 zmxid="zoomXimageId6" md5="" sourcedescription="编辑提供的本地文件"   sourcename="本地文件"></FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>I consider   warning her that she will never again read a newspaper without thinking: "What   if that had been MY child?" That every plane crash, every house fire will haunt   her. That when she sees pictures of starving children, she will wonder if   anything could be worse than watching your child die. I look at her carefully   manicured nails and stylish suit and think that no matter how sophisticated she   is, becoming a mother will reduce her to the primitive level of a bear   protecting her cub.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>I feel I   should warn her that no matter how many years she has invested in her career,   she will be professionally derailed by motherhood. She might arrange for child   care, but one day she will be going into an important business meeting, and she   will think her baby's sweet smell. She will have to use every ounce of   discipline to keep from running home, just to make sure her child is all   right.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>I want my   friend to know that every decision will no longer be routine. That a   five-year-old boy's desire to go to the men's room rather than the women's at a   restaurant will become a major dilemma. The issues of independence and gender   identity will be weighed against the prospect that a child molester may be   lurking in the lavatory. However decisive she may be at the office, she will   second-guess herself constantly as a mother.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Looking at   my attractive friend, I want to assure her that eventually she will shed the   added weight of pregnancy, but she will never feel the same about herself. That   her own life, now so important, will be of less value to her once she has a   child. She would give it up in a moment to save her offspring, but will also   begin to hope for more years―not to accomplish her own dreams―but to watch her   children accomplish theirs.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>I want to   describe to my friend the exhilaration of seeing your child learn to hit a ball.   I want to capture for her the belly laugh of a baby who is touching the soft fur   of a dog for the first time. I want her to taste the joy that is so real it   hurts.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>My   friend's look makes me realize that tears have formed in my eyes. "You'll never   regret it," I say finally. Then, squeezing my friend's hand, I offer a prayer   for her and me and all of the mere mortal women who stumble their way into this   holiest of callings.</FONT></P></DIV></DIV></div>
