  <div><DIV>  <DIV class=sanjineiwen>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Growing   up, I always wanted a dog. Probably because most of my friends had them, my   favorite TV families had them, and it just seemed normal, and American, to have   a pooch in the house.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>My Dad is   very clean. Not just clean, I might say more Danny Tanner-ish in his habits. As   in, he hoses down the backyard, and front walkway, and even gets halfway down   the street, just for fun, until we have to yell, "Dad, you're wasting water! You   can't hose down the world!" Then he stops, and comes inside, and starts the very   important task of scrubbing the fingerprint smudges off the walls.</FONT></P>  <P align=right><FONT face=Arial><IMG   style="BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 0px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 0px solid; BORDER-TOP: #000000 0px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 0px solid"   id=1258367 title="" border=0 alt="My furry friend 我最好的朋友" align=right   src="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/language_tips/book/attachement/jpg/site1/20090326/0013729e41a90b357ccc02.jpg"   width=323 height=241 zmxid="zoomXimageId6" md5="" sourcedescription="编辑提供的本地文件"   sourcename="本地文件"></FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>So, no   dog. When I was eight, we moved across town to a larger house, with a pool, in a   "safer" neighborhood, in a gated community. With a large yard. I was very   against moving. Why, I cried, were we picking up and deserting everything and   everyone we knew and loved?! Our old house was great, we had an avocado tree, it   was on a super steep hill, what more could you want?! Well, in order to calm me   down, I guess, my parents told me that we could get a dog when we moved to the   new, barren home. I was sold. I quickly shut my trap.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>I feel it   was serendipitous that we didn't get a dog after the move. My parents said that   I would never walk it, which I vehemently denied, but which was probably true.   And saying we would get a dog and not following through was pretty much the ONLY   thing my parents ever promised that didn't happen in my life so far. I guilted   them about it for a few years, sobbing on holidays when I said "the only thing I   want is a dog" and refused presents. Then snuck them into my room on the   sly.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>I am in my   twenties now, and our new roommate just moved in. She has a dog. A West Highland   Terrier, or Westie, as they are known. He is fluffy, but not too fluffy, small,   but not too small, white, but not too white. He is perfect.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>I don't   even believe in perfection really, but this dog is perfect for ME. Its the dog I   always dreamt of having, and it loves me as I knew a dog would. It follows me   into the bathroom when I shower. At first we would scare each other, I was not   used to having a non-human, living thing with a beating heart following me   around and it would surprise me around corners.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Slowly, we   got used to each other. Now I can tell when the dog needs to go out, or when he   just sees a few birds in our yard. I give the doggie water, I walk him, and I   teach him boundaries. My boyfriend was impressed when I taught him how to lie in   his bed while the humans are eating, so as not to bother us. "I can't believe he   listens to you." As Cesar Millan would say, I am the Alpha Dog.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>In some   ways, I am glad I have (been forced to) wait until this age to have a dog   around. I don't take him for granted. I am happy every morning when I wake up   and hear his little nails clicking across the floor. We are a good match. I can   see how a dog is not for everyone. They are very needy and require a lot of   attention and affection and structure.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Now my   parents are semi-retired but my Dad travels a lot for work. He's off to   Luxembourg, Mexico, or the Turks and Caicos every month. I ask my Mom if she   would like a dog to keep her company. She says no, she has a stepdog now (ours)   and she can visit it whenever she wants.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>And yes,   my furry friend will go with me wherever I want to go and whenever, he is very   accomodating like that.</FONT></P></DIV></DIV></div>
