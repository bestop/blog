Many referred to it simply as the "Fifteenth of the Eighth   Moon".</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><FONT   style="FONT-SIZE: 16pt"><FONT style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt"><FONT   style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt" size=1>This day was also considered as a harvest   festival since fruits, vegetables and grain had been harvested by this time and   food was abundant. Food offerings were placed on an altar set up in the   courtyard. Apples, pears, peaches, grapes, pomegranates（石榴）, melons, oranges and   pomelos（柚子） might be seen. Special foods for the festival included moon cakes,   cooked taro（芋头）and water caltrope（菱角）, a type of water chestnut resembling black   buffalo horns. Some people insisted that cooked taro be included because at the   time of creation, taro was the first food discovered at night in the moonlight.   Of all these foods, it could not be omitted from the Mid-Autumn   Festival.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><FONT   style="FONT-SIZE: 16pt"><FONT style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt"><FONT   style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt" size=1>The round moon cakes, measuring about three   inches in diameter and one and a half inches in thickness, resembled Western   fruitcakes in taste and consistency. These cakes were made with melon   seeds（西瓜子）, lotus seeds（莲籽）, almonds（杏仁）, minced meats, bean paste, orange peels   and lard（猪油）. A golden yolk（蛋黄） from a salted duck egg was placed at the center   of each cake, and the golden brown crust was decorated with symbols of the   festival. Traditionally, thirteen moon cakes were piled in a pyramid to   symbolize the thirteen moons of a "complete year," that is, twelve moons plus   one intercalary（闰月的） moon.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><FONT   style="FONT-SIZE: 16pt"><FONT style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt"><FONT   style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt" size=1>The Mid-Autumn Festival is a traditional   festivity for both the Han and minority nationalities. The custom of worshipping   the moon can be traced back as far as the ancient Xia and Shang Dynasties (2000   B.C.-1066 B.C.). In the Zhou Dynasty(1066 B.C.-221 B.C.), people hold ceremonies   to greet winter and worship the moon whenever the Mid-Autumn Festival sets in.   It becomes very prevalent in the Tang Dynasty(618-907 A.D.) that people enjoy   and worship the full moon. In the Southern Song Dynasty (1127-1279 A.D.),   however, people send round moon cakes to their relatives as gifts in expression   of their best wishes of family reunion. When it becomes dark, they look up at   the full silver moon or go sightseeing on lakes to celebrate the festival. Since   the Ming (1368-1644 A.D. ) and Qing Dynasties (1644-1911A.D.), the custom of   Mid-Autumn Festival celebration becomes unprecedented popular. Together with the   celebration there appear some special customs in different parts of the country,   such as burning incense（熏香）, planting Mid-Autumn trees, lighting lanterns on   towers and fire dragon dances. However, the custom of playing under the moon is   not so popular as it used to be nowadays, but it is not less popular to enjoy   the bright silver moon. Whenever the festival sets in, people will look up at   the full silver moon, drinking wine to celebrate their happy life or thinking of   their relatives and friends far from home, and extending all of their best   wishes to them.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>  <P style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt"></P><FONT style="FONT-SIZE: 16pt"><FONT   style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt"><FONT style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt" size=1>Moon   Cakes</FONT></FONT></FONT>   <P style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt" align=right><FONT style="FONT-SIZE: 16pt"><FONT   style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt"><FONT style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt" size=1><IMG id=574915   height=137   src="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/language_tips/easyEnglish/attachement/jpg/site1/20070924/0013204d7c5a0861a75304.jpg"   width=160 align=right md5=""></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>  <P style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt"><FONT style="FONT-SIZE: 16pt"><FONT   style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt"><FONT style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt" size=1>There is this story   about the moon-cake. during the Yuan dynasty (A.D. 1280-1368) China was ruled by   the Mongolian people.
