Responses from the men indicated that they   took significantly longer to get over their lost loves than the women. Some of   the men were not satisfied with the survey choices: the last choice listed was,   "Over 10 years." Only men crossed out all the choices and wrote, "I never got   over her!" While no doubt some women never got over their lost loves, either,   only men wrote this comment on the survey.</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">Adolescent boys are "not   supposed" to cry over lost loves. But many of my male participants reported   that, after their high school girlfriends broke up with them, they cried in   private, every night, for months.</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">My lost love reunion findings   about romantic men paralleled results of my survey of adults who never tried   lost love reunions. There were significantly more men than women who chose to   fill out the survey, and they expressed strong feelings for their first loves,   even though they had not contacted these women (and may never do so).</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">Posts on the Message Board of   my web site, Lostlovers.com, are more represented by women than men. But   appearances are misleading. Actually, there are more men who are members of my   site than women. The men don't post as often as the women, but they are   reading!</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">Men more often sign up for   private phone consultations to talk about their lost loves than women.</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">But it is a rare men's   magazine that will print a story about love and romance. The editors tell me   that they think men are uninterested. Not so! When my research was quoted in   Playboy, it generated a lot of responses.</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">On occasions where romance is   expected (such as Valentine's Day, birthdays or anniversaries), we should all   remember to separate emotions from behaviors. Men may not make scrapbooks of   mementos of their love experiences, but they are every bit as loving, loyal, and   yes, romantic, as women - and sometimes more so!</P></FONT></DIV></div>
