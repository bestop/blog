  <div><DIV>  <DIV class=3jiriqi><FONT face=Arial>It hurts to love someone and not be loved in   return. But what is more painful is to love someone and never find the courage   to let that person know how you feel.</FONT></DIV>  <DIV class=3jiriqi><FONT face=Arial></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV class=3jineiwen>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>A sad thing in life is when you   meet someone who means a lot to you, only to find out in the end that it was   never meant to be and you just have to let go.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>The best kind of friend is the   kind you can sit on a porch swing with, never say a word, and then walk away   feeling like it was the best conversation you've ever had.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>It's true that we don't know   what we've got until we lose it, but it's also true that we don't know what   we've been missing until it arrives.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>It takes only a minute to get a   crush on someone, an hour to like someone, and a day to love someone- but it   takes a lifetime to forget someone. Don't go for looks; they can deceive. Don't   go for wealth, even that fades away. Go for someone who makes you smile because   it takes only a smile to make a dark day seem bright.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Dream what you want to dream;   go where you want to go; be what you want to be, because you have only one life   and one chance to do all the things you want to do.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Always put yourself in the   other's shoes. If you feel that it hurts you, it probably hurts the person   too.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>A careless word may kindle   strife; a cruel word may wreck a life; a timely word may level stress; a loving   word may heal and bless.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>The happiest of people don't   necessarily have the best of everything they just make the most of everything   that comes along their way.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Love begins with a smile, grows   with a kiss, ends with a tear. When you were born, you were crying and everyone   around you was smiling. Live your life so that when you die, you're the one   smiling and everyone around you is crying.</FONT></P></DIV></DIV></div>
