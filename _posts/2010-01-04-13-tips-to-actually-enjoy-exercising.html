  <div><DIV><FONT size=2>  <DIV class=sanjiriqi>Is staying in shape always something that gets bumped to   the bottom of your list? I know many people that complain about not having   enough time to exercise. I think they are lying to themselves. The real problem   is that they hate exercising, so it will never be a priority.</DIV>  <DIV class=sanjineiwen>  <P align=right><IMG style="WIDTH: 200px; HEIGHT: 200px" id=819552 title=""   border=0 hspace=0 alt="13 Tips to Actually Enjoy Exercising" align=right   src="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/language_tips/book/attachement/jpg/site1/20080508/0013729e42d2098cf9360a.jpg"   width=200 height=200 zmxid="zoomXimageId6" md5="" sourcedescription="编辑提供的本地文件"   sourcename="本地文件"></P>  <P></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px">I used to hate exercising too. Going to the gym,   running and most forms of physical activity seemed dull and painful compared to   most other ways I could spend my time. But by not giving up and looking for a   way I could enjoy working out, I reversed this pattern. Now I exercise 5-6 times   per week and I hate not being able to go.</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px">Here's some tips to make exercise something you   actually want to do:</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px">Make it a Habit - Remove the thinking element.   If you can make exercise a habit, then it becomes that much easier to go. Here's   some tips on making habits stick if you aren't sure where to start.</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px">Get a Partner - Get someone else to go to the   gym with you. Pick someone who is committed to their health. Not only can you   socialize with someone while you're there, but you'll have a backup in case your   motivation alone isn't enough to drag yourself out there.</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px">Tune Your Challenge Level - Here are two bad   ways to start exercising. Go out and run until your winded and dry-heaving into   a ditch. Show up to the gym, walk around, don't do anything strenuous and go   back Home. In one case you put the challenge level to high, the other wasn't   challenging at all. Your goal is to set a workout routine that is challenging,   but not overwhelming. Challenge is key to enjoyment.</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px">Set goals - Not weight-loss or muscle gain   goals, but fitness goals. Set goals to beat your past records in distance ran,   push-ups or chin-ups you can do, weight you can lift or degree you can stretch.   Fitness goals make the gym a game where you strive to beat your previous   high-score.</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px">Get Past Your Comfort Zone - So what if you   aren't the most svelte or muscular person in the gym? Self-consciousness can be   a big obstacle to enjoying your workout. The key is to get used to it. When you   continue to show up, you'll pay less attention to the people around you and more   to your workout.</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px">Experiment - Don't stick with the same routine.   Mix it up and try different activities. There are many different exercise   routines you can follow or activities to try. If you don't like lifting weights   or running, try sports, martial arts or dancing. Assuming that exercise needs to   be pumping iron or jogging may limit you from finding something you would truly   enjoy.</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px">music - This shouldn't come as a surprise, but   music can enhance a workout. I find running almost twice as enjoyable with music   than without it.</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px">Short Workouts - Don't have time or enthusiasm   to last an hour? Just go for twenty or thirty minutes. Shorter workouts can be   better than longer ones if the intensity is higher and you become more focused   as a result. After an hour or two of exercise your body starts to go into a   state where more exercise can actually reduce physical improvements.</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px">Daily Challenges - Make your workout into a   game. Sticking with the same type of exercises can get boring, so mix it up by   introducing an unusual workout challenge. My gym partner and I have played a   game that involves sit-ups and a deck of cards or one workout day that involves   different types of push-ups. If you aren't sure where to get ideas, look through   a magazine like Mens Fitness which usually features a variety of different   workouts.</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px">Health Top Tips Nutrition Lifestyle</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px">Reward Showing Up, Not Weight Loss - Some people   have gotten the idea that they should reward themselves for losing weight or   gaining muscle. I disagree. Instead, I think you should reward showing up to the   gym and exercising regularly. There are many ways you can lose or gain weight in   unhealthy fashions. Rewarding exercise is rewarding your commitment to   health.</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px">Make Exercise Your Stress Relief - I know many   people that swear by using the gym to relieve stress. Some of them will head to   the gym because of a frustrating day even if it isn't on their schedule.   Exercising can be cathartic and release negative feelings if you get used to   using it that way. Then instead of avoiding the gym because of a stressful day,   it will be your reason to go.</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px">Record Improvements - Again I recommend   recording fitness over body improvements. Recording weight loss or muscle gain   is a good idea, but because of the way your metabolism functions it becomes   increasingly harder to make weight changes as you go to the gym more regularly.   But fitness improvements can, if you work on it, continue to rise. Keep a record   of your strength, endurance and flexibility so you can get pride in your   accomplishments.</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px">Make Time - You can't say you don't have time to   exercise. Exercise improves your energy levels and mood which makes you more   productive than any time lost. Find your forty minutes somewhere in the day and   make it a commitment. Get up a bit earlier and go in the morning. Or schedule it   right after work before you settle down for the day. Once you make time and make   it a habit, you'll actually want to exercise instead of just feeling you   should.</P></DIV></FONT></DIV></div>
