  <div><DIV><FONT face=Arial>You have a choice I woke up early today, excited over all   I get to do before the clock strikes midnight. I have responsibilities to   fulfill today. I am important. <BR><BR>My job is to choose what kind of day I am   going to have. <BR><BR>Today I can complain because the weather is rainy or I   can be thankful that the grass is getting watered for free. <BR><BR>Today I can   fell sad that I don't have more money or I can be glad that my finances   encourage me to plan my purchases wisely and guide me away from waste.   <BR><BR>Today I can grumble about my health or I can rejoice that I am alive.   <BR><BR>Today I can lament over all that my parents didn't give me when I was   growing up or I can feel grateful that they allowed me to be born. <BR><BR>Today   I can cry because roses have thorns or I can celebrate that thorns have roses.   <BR><BR>Today I can mourn my lack of friends or I can excitedly embark upon a   quest to discover new relationships. <BR><BR>Today I can murmur dejectedly   because I have to do housework or I can feel honored because the Lord has   provided shelter for my mind, body and soul. <BR><BR>Today stretches ahead of   me, waiting to be shaped. And here I am, the sculptor who gets to do the   shaping. <BR><BR>What today will be like is up to me. I get to choose what kind   of day I will have!</FONT></DIV></div>
