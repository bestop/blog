One day while working at the cash register in the gift shop, I saw an   elderly couple come in with a little girl in a wheelchair.</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px">As I looked closer at this girl, I saw that she   was kind of perched on her chair. I then realized she had no arms or legs, just   a head, neck and torso. She was wearing a little white dress with red polka   dots.</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px">As the couple wheeled her up to me I was looking   down at the register. I turned my head toward the girl and gave her a wink. As I   took the money from her grandparents, I looked back at the girl, who was giving   me the cutest, largest smile I have ever seen.</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px">All of a sudden her handicap was gone and all I   saw was this beautiful girl, whose smile just melted me and almost instantly   gave me a completely new sense of what life is all about. She took me from a   poor, unhappy college student and brought me into her world; a world of smiles,   love and warmth.</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px">That was ten years ago. I'm a successful   business person now and whenever I get down and think about the troubles of the   world, I think about that little girl and the remarkable lesson about life that   she taught me.</P></FONT></DIV></div>
