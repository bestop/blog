  <div><p>&quot;Everything happens for the best,&quot; my mother said whenever I faced disappointment. &quot;If you carry on, one day something good will happen. And you&#39;ll realize that it wouldn&#39;t have happened if not for that previous disappointment.&quot;</p>  <p>Mother was right, as I discovered after graduating from college in 1932. I had decided to try for a job in radio, then work my way up to sports announcer. I hitchhiked to Chicago and knocked on the door of every station - and got turned down every time.</p>  <p>In one studio, a kind lady told me that big stations couldn&#39;t risk hiring an inexperienced person. &quot;Go out in the sticks and find a small station that&#39;ll give you a chance,&quot; she said.</p> <p>I thumbed home to Dixon, Illinois. While there was no radio-announcing jobs in Dixon, my father said Montgomery Ward had opened a store and wanted a local athlete to manage its sports department. Since Dixon was where I had played high school football, I applied. The job sounded just right for me. But I wasn&#39;t hired.</p>  <p>My disappointment must have shown. &quot;Everything happens for the best,&quot; Mom reminded me. Dad offered me the car to job hunt. I tried WOC Radio in Davenport, Iowa. The program director, a wonderful Scotsman named Peter MacArthur, told me they had already hired an announcer.</p>  <p>As I left his office, my frustration boiled over. I asked aloud, &quot;How can a fellow get to be a sports announcer if he can&#39;t get a job in a radio station?&quot;</p> <p>I was waiting for the elevator when I heard MacArthur calling, &quot;What was that you said about sports? Do you know anything about football?&quot; Then he stood me before a microphone and asked me to broadcast an imaginary game.</p>  <p>On my way home, as I have many times since, I thought of my mother&#39;s words: &quot;If you carry on, one day something good will happen. Something wouldn&#39;t have happened if not for that previous disappointment.&quot;</p>  <p>I often wonder what direction my life might have taken if I&#39;d gotten the job at Montgomery Ward.</p> </div>
