  <div>They say that blood is thicker than water, that our relatives are more important to us than others. Everyone <br /> <br />was so kind to the old lady on her birthday. Surely her daughter would make an even bigger effort to please he? <br /> <br />　　The Present <br /> <br />　　It was the old lady's birthday. <br />　　She got up early to be ready for the post. From the second floor flat she could see the postman when he came <br /> <br />down the street, and the little boy from the ground floor brought up her letters on the rare occasions when <br /> <br />anything came. <br />　　Today she was sure the would be something. Myra wouldn't forget her mother's birthday, even if she seldom <br /> <br />wrote at other times. Of course Myra was busy. Her husband had been made Mayor, and Myra herself had got a medal <br /> <br />for her work the aged. <br />　　The old lady was proud of Myra, but Enid was the daughter she loved. Enid had never married, but had seemed <br /> <br />content to live with her mother, and teach in a primary school round the corner. <br />　　One evening, however, Enid said, "I've arranged for Mrs. Morrison to look after you for a few days, Mother. <br /> <br />Tomorrow I have to go into hospital--just a minor operation, I'll soon be home." <br />　　In the morning she went, but never came back--she died on the operating table. Myra came to the funeral, and <br /> <br />in her efficient way arranged for Mrs. Morrison to come in and light the fire and give the old lady her <br /> <br />breakfast. <br />　　Two years ago that was, and since then Myra had been to see her mother three times, but her husband never. <br />　　The old lady was eight today. She had put on her best dress. Perhaps--perhaps Myra might come. After all, <br /> <br />eighty was a special birthday, another decade lined or endured just as you chose to look at it. <br />　　Even if Myra did not come, she would send a present. The old lady was sure of that. Two spots of colour <br /> <br />brightened her cheeks. She was excited--like a child. She would enjoy her day. <br />　　Yesterday Mrs. Morrison had given the flat an extra clean, and today she had brought a card and a bunch of <br /> <br />marigolds when she came to do the breakfast. Mrs. Grant downstairs had made a cake, and in the afternoon she was <br /> <br />going down there to tea. The little boy, Johnnie, had been up with a packet of mints, and said he wouldn't go <br /> <br />out to play until the post had come. <br />　　"I guess you'll get lots and lots of presents," he said, "I did last were when I was six." <br />　　What would she like? A pair of slippers perhaps. Or a new cardigan. A cardigan would be lovely. Blue's such <br /> <br />a pretty colour. Jim had always liked her in blue. Or a table lamp. Or a book, a travel book, with piures, or a <br /> <br />little clock, with clear black numbers. So many lovely things. <br />　　She stood by the window, watching. The postman turned round the corner on his bicycle. Her heart beat fast. <br /> <br />Johnnie had seen him too and ran to the gate. <br />　　Then clatter, clatter up the stairs. Johnnie knocked at her door. <br />　　"Granny, granny," he shouted, "I've got your post." <br />　　He gave her four envelopes. Three were unsealed cards from old friends. The fourth was sealed, in Myra's <br /> <br />writing. The old lady felt a pang of disappointment. <br />　　"No parcel, Johnnie?" <br />　　"No, granny." <br />　　Maybe the parcel was too large to come by letter post. That was it. It would come later by parcel post. She <br /> <br />must be patient. <br />　　Almost reluantly she tore the envelope open. Folded in the card was a piece of paper. Written on the card <br /> <br />was a message under the printed Happy Birthday -- Buy yourself something nice with the cheque, Myra and Harold. <br />　　The cheque fluttered to the floor like a bird with a broken wing. Slowly the old lady stooped to pick it up. <br /> <br />Her present, her lovely present. With trembling fingers she tore it into little bits.</div>
