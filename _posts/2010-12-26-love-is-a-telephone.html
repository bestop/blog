  <div><DIV>  <P><FONT face=Arial>Love is a telephone which always keeps silent when you are   longing for a call, but rings when you are not ready for it. As a result, we   often miss the sweetness from the other end.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>Love is a telephone which is seldom program-controlled or   directly dialed. You cannot get an immediate answer by a mere "hello", let alone   go deep into your lover's heart by one call. Usually it had to be relayed by an   operator, and you have to be patient in waiting. Destiny is the operator of this   phone, who is always irresponsible and fond of laying practical jokes to which   she may make you a lifelong victim intentionally or unintentionally.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>Love is a telephone which is always busy, When you are ready   to die for love, you only find, to your disappointment, the line is already   occupied by someone else, and you are greeted only by a busy line. This is an   eternal regret handed down from generation to generation and you are only one of   those who languish for followers.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>Love is telephone, but it is difficult to seize the center   time for dialing, and you will let slip the opportunity if your call is either   too early or too late.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>Love is a telephone which is not always associated with   happiness. Honeyed words are transmitted by sound waves, but when the lovers are   brought together, the phone servers no purpose that many lovers observe that   marriage is the doom of love.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>Love is a telephone which, when you use it for the first   time, makes you so nervous and excited that you either hold the receiver upside   down or dial the wrong number. By the time you've calmed down, you will beat a   loss to whom you should make the call.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>Love is a telephone which often has crossed lines. And this   usually happens to you unexpectedly. Your time will either cross or be crossed.   Both cases are refereed to as "triangle". Fortunately, all such occurrences are   transient.</FONT></P></DIV></div>
