  <div><DIV>  <DIV class=sanjiriqi><FONT face=Arial>There once was a king who offered a prize   to the artist who would paint the best picture of peace. Many artists tried. The   king looked at all the pictures. But there were only two he really liked, and he   had to choose between them. One picture was of a calm lake. The lake was a   perfect mirror for peaceful towering mountains all around it. Overhead was a   blue sky with fluffy white clouds. All who saw this picture thought that it was   a perfect picture of peace.</FONT></DIV>  <DIV class=sanjineiwen>  <P align=right><FONT face=Arial><IMG style="WIDTH: 200px; HEIGHT: 137px"   id=982229 title="" border=0 alt="The Real Meaning of Peace" align=right   src="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/language_tips/book/attachement/jpg/site1/20080902/0013729e42d20a26d93704.jpg"   zmxid="zoomXimageId6" md5="" sourcedescription="编辑提供的本地文件"   sourcename="本地文件"></FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial></FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>The other picture had   mountains, too. But these were rugged and bare. Above was an angry sky, from   which rain fell and in which lightning played. Down the side of the mountain   tumbled a foaming waterfall. This did not look peaceful at all.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>But when the king looked   closely, he saw behind the waterfall a tiny bush growing in a crack in the rock.   In the bush a mother bird had built her nest. There, in the midst of the rush of   angry water, sat the mother bird on her nest ― in perfect peace.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Which picture do you think won   the prize? The king chose the second picture. Do you know why?</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"Because," explained the king,   "peace does not mean to be in a place where there is no noise, trouble, or hard   work. Peace means to be in the midst of all those things and still be calm in   your heart. That is the real meaning of   peace."</FONT></P></DIV></DIV></div>
