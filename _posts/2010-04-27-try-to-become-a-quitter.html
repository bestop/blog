  <div><DIV>  <DIV class=sanjineiwen>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 1.5pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>I'm one of   those people who's terrible at saying no. I take on too many projects at once,   and spend too much of my time doing things I'd rather not be. I get stuff done,   but it's not always the best I can do, or the best way I can spend my   time.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 1.5pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>That's why   my newest goal, both as a professional and a person, is to be a   quitter.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 1.5pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Being a   quitter isn't being someone who gives up, who doesn't see important things   through to the end. I aspire to be the opposite of those things, and think we   all should. The quitter I want to be is someone who gets out when there's no   value to be added, or when that value comes at the expense of something more   important.</FONT></P>  <P align=right><FONT face=Arial><IMG   style="BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 0px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 0px solid; BORDER-TOP: #000000 0px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 0px solid"   id=1301063 title="" border=0 alt="Try to become a quitter 学会放弃" align=right   src="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/language_tips/book/attachement/jpg/site1/20090423/0013729e41a90b5a64f00a.jpg"   width=223 height=290 zmxid="zoomXimageId6" md5="" sourcedescription="编辑提供的本地文件"   sourcename="本地文件"></FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 1.5pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>I want to   quit doing things that I'm asked to do, for no other reason than I'm asked to do   it. I want to be able to quit something in mid-stream, because I realize there's   nothing good coming from it.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 1.5pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>A friend of   mine once told me that "I knew I was an adult when I could stop reading a book,   even after getting 500 pages into it." Odd though it sounds, we all tend to do   this. We get involved in something, realize we don't want to be a part of it,   but keep trucking through. We say "well, I've already invested so much time in   this, I might as well stick it out."</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 1.5pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>I propose   the opposite: quit as often as possible, regardless of project status or time   invested. If you're reading a book, and don't like it, stop reading. Cut your   losses, realize that the smartest thing to do is stop before your losses grow   even more, and quit. If you're working on a project at work that isn't going   anywhere, but you've already invested tons of time on it, quit. Take the time   gained by quitting the pointless project, and put it toward something of value.   Instead of reading an entire book you hate, read 1/2 a bad one and 1/2 a good   one. Isn't that a better use of your time?</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 1.5pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>If you're   stuck doing something, and don't really want to do it anymore, step back for a   second. Ask if you really have to do this, and what value is being produced from   your doing it. Don't think about the time you've put into it, or how much it's   taken over your life. If you don't want to do it, and don't have to do it, don't   do it.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 1.5pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>By quitting   these things, you'll free up time to do things that actually do create value,   for yourself and for others. You'll have time to read all the great books out   there, or at least a couple more. You'll be able to begin to put your time and   effort into the things you'd actually like to do.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 1.5pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Let's try   it together: what are the things you're doing, that you're only doing because   you've been doing them for so long? Quit. Don't let time spent dictate time you   will spend. Let's learn how to say "no" at the beginning, or in the middle, and   free up more of our time to do the things we'd like to be doing, and the things   actually worth doing.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 1.5pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Saying no   is hard, and admitting a mistaken yes is even harder. But if we do both, we'll   start to make sure that we're spending our time creating value, rather than   aggravating our losses. Let's be quitters together.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 1.5pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>What do you   think? What in your life can you quit?</FONT></P></DIV></DIV></div>
