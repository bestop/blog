  <div><DIV><FONT face=Arial>I teach economics at UNLV three times per week. Last   Monday, at the beginning of class, I cheerfully asked my students how their   weekend had been. One young man said that his weekend had not been so good. He   had his wisdom teeth removed. The young man then proceeded to ask me why I   always seemed to be so cheerful. <BR><BR>His question reminded me of something   I'd read somewhere before: "Every morning when you get up, you have a choice   about how you want to approach life that day," I said. "I choose to be   cheerful." <BR><BR>"Let me give you an example," I continued, addressing all   sixty students in the class. "In addition to teaching here at UNLV, I also teach   out at the community college in Henderson, 17 miles down the freeway from where   I live. One day a few weeks ago I drove those 17 miles to Henderson. I exited   the freeway and turned onto College Drive. I only had to drive another quarter   mile down the road to the college. But just then my car died. I tried to start   it again, but the engine wouldn't turn over. So I put my flashers on, grabbed my   books, and marched down the road to the college." <BR><BR>"As soon as I got   there I called AAA and arranged for a tow truck to meet me at my car after   class. The secretary in the Provost's office asked me what has happened. 'This   is my lucky day,' I replied, smiling." <BR><BR>" 'Your car breaks down and today   is your lucky day?' She was puzzled. 'What do you mean?'" <BR><BR>" 'I live 17   miles from here.' I replied. 'My car could have broken down anywhere along the   freeway. It didn't. Instead, it broke down in the perfect place: off the   freeway, within walking distance of here. I'm still able to teach my class, and   I've been able to arrange for the tow truck to meet me after class. If my car   was meant to break down today, it couldn't have been arranged in a more   convenient fashion.'" <BR><BR>"The secretary's eyes opened wide, and then she   smiled. I smiled back and headed for class." So ended my story. <BR><BR>I   scanned the sixty faces in my economics class at UNLV. Despite the early hour,   no one seemed to be asleep. Somehow, my story had touched them. Or maybe it   wasn't the story at all. In fact, it had all started with a student's   observation that I was cheerful.</FONT></DIV></div>
