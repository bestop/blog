  <div><DIV>  <DIV class=sanjineiwen>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>I have   frequented the same chat line for more than three years now and have made some   wonderful online friendships. However I have become bored with the typical chat   and Internet all together. So, I decided to take a break.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>After about   a week of being off line, I returned late one night to check mail. There, in my   box was an emai1 from a lady friend I had met in a chat room. She was going on   and on about a man that had recently entered the room and how he was supposedly   the "male incarnate" of myself. Anyone who knows me also knows that I am a bit   of a "character." My sense of humor is one of a warped and demented nature. The   thought of finding anyone who doesn't become annoyed instantly is a chore. Much   less a man that shared the same. I completely discredited the email and went   about my business.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Later that   night, I found myself wandering the net. It was then I ran across a photo   gallery that proved to be quite entertaining. As I clicked from one picture to   the next, I ran across one gentleman's photo. I was stunned by his presence.   Approximately 10 minuets had gone by when I finally tore myself away from the   photo and decided to venture into chat. There, I found the woman who had sent me   the email earlier that week. She proceeded to tell me all about this man. "You   just have to meet him," she said, ranting on and on about how much alike we   were. I laughed at her thinking it was amusing. "No, I am serious! You have got   to talk to him." I finally agreed that I would make effort to do so later on and   left the chat quickly. Again, finding myself staring at this anonymous photo I   had found earlier.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT   face=Arial>Approximately 4 hours later, I ventured back into the chat. Only to   find a few friends talking about daily events. Then all of a sudden out of   nowhere, a new name entered, rambling on and on about being the presentment of   madness. I quickly spoke up and told the stranger that title had already been   taken by myself as I laughed. He was silent for a few moments. It was then I   received a "whisper" from him. "So you are the woman I have heard so very much   about." I replied by saying, "I see my reputation precedes me." It was then I   noticed his side bar photo (this particular room has a side bar option for those   wishing to post photos of themselves). I almost fell from my chair when I   realized I was talking to the man in the photo. The photo I had found earlier   that day while surfing. After several hours in "whisper" mode, we opted to enter   my personal chat room. We found one another to be interesting. Not to mention,   we thoroughly enjoyed our conversation.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Since then,   our relationship has grown tremendously. Even going so far as to admit our love   to one another. We both agree this seems crazy. The sort of thing you read about   in a book. It hardly seems real. Neither of us was looking when fate let us to   one another. Neither of us was in need of love. Hell, neither of us believed in   love, especially online love prior to our finding one another. We both want so   badly to be together. To 1earn, to love, and to experience what this has to   offer. It is simply amazing. So much for not seeking love, eh?</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>It was as   if we had been two long lost lovers being reunited after a long trip. I think he   put it best when he said… "Life is full of shit…lots of it. And there are many a   time when you may feel stuck/bored and it seems that there's nothing left to   hold your interest or anything that doesn't piss you off. Well, there is such a   thing as true love. It's there, it's indescribable and few are blessed with it.   We are one of lucky couples."</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Truly, the   luckiest man and woman ever.</FONT></P></DIV></DIV></div>
