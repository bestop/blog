  <div><DIV>  <P><FONT face=Arial>Some work friends and I were recently discussing things that   men can not criticize their girlfriends about. It was astounding how incorrect   us guys were when trying to lay out our "rights" in terms of constructive   criticism. The women in the office were appalled at what we thought we were   allowed to talk about. If I could figure out what I am allowed to criticize and   what I should stay away from, I'd avoid arguments and do a better job of hitting   on girls.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>I'm guilty of saying things to women that only their best   girlfriends, gay male friends, and moms/sisters are allowed to say. I put   together a list below:</FONT></P>  <P><STRONG><FONT face=Arial>Weight</FONT></STRONG></P>  <P align=right><FONT face=Arial><IMG   style="BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 0px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 0px solid; BORDER-TOP: #000000 0px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 0px solid"   id=1831144 title="" border=0 alt=谈论女性时的禁区 align=right   src="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/language_tips/book/attachement/jpg/site1/20090921/0013729e41a90c213deb4e.jpg"   width=363 height=242 md5="" sourcedescription="编辑提供的本地文件"   sourcename="本地文件"></FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>There is no friendly way for a guy to tell a girl that she's   put on weight. Even if there was a friendly way, most of the women I've talked   to about it said they would not want to hear it from a guy. It seems obvious,   but not all guys know this. We polled some of the guys in our office, and the   prevailing male opinion was as long as she's your girlfriend, or you've known   each other for a while, then you can make weight loss suggestions. I think the   best policy is silence. If I'm desperate to make a suggestion, maybe I tell one   of her girlfriends to do it on my behalf.</FONT></P>  <P><STRONG><FONT face=Arial>Outfit</FONT></STRONG></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>I think I'm only allowed to say someone generally looks   nice, or I like her shirt or whatever. Getting too detailed or negative gets me   in trouble. In fact, I attempted to "add on" to a compliment I gave a girl once.   I told her she looked great, because she had a new outfit on. Now, remembering   those times I saw my sisters or friends bark back "thanks, and just $30 from   Target," I tried to double up on my compliment: "and it looks like you didn't   pay much money either." She ended up crying. I've been told by women that they   dress more to impress other women anyway, and not guys. Basically, I need to   stick to "you look great" and leave it there. And I should probably avoid saying   I don't like something a girl is wearing. That can only lead to no   good.</FONT></P>  <P><STRONG><FONT face=Arial>Friends/Family</FONT></STRONG></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>We've all dated people with annoying friends. But, people   consider their friends as extensions of themselves so if you criticize friends,   you're criticizing your significant other indirectly. My older sister has a good   system of putting the word "that" in front of any of her husband's friends that   annoy her. "Oh you're going with that Mike to the concert?" It's not an   aggressive attack, just a little poke. Family is the same rule, but you probably   get in even more trouble if you criticize the family of a significant   other.</FONT></P>  <P><STRONG><FONT face=Arial>Driving</FONT></STRONG></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>Every guy thinks he's a better driver than his girlfriend. I   can learn a lot from my little sister's boyfriend. One day, my sister was   driving the two of us to Baltimore for a weekend. My sister is a really bad   driver. She doesn't brake when she sees brake lights ahead until she absolutely   has to. This leads to passenger whiplash and nausea. During this trip I said:   "you know, you can brake earlier- that way you're not slamming on the brakes at   the last minute and making us all sick." She said: "do I do that?" I turned   around to her boyfriend for confirmation and he simply said: "no comment". My   sister's boyfriend loves me because I am allowed to verbalize all the criticisms   that he's thinking.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>I like the "no comment" policy. But I can't stand not to   give my opinion to women, even when it's bad. I want to learn the things I   should hold off from criticizing about women. Do you agree with the items above?   What do you hate being criticized about by guys?</FONT></P></DIV></div>
