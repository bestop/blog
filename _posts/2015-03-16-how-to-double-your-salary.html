  <div><div class="WordSection1">  <p style="mso-margin-top-alt:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:22.5pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:18.0pt;background:white;vertical-align:baseline">  <span style="font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:#4D4F51">For every professional out there who is unemployed or under-employed, the recession is about to create a great opportunity for you to focus your skills and leverage your strengths. The chance   to negotiate for more pay and better jobs will be increased too. You'll have a chance to make up for the income you may have lost in the last five years. However, don't lose yourself in the process! Be mindful and strategic with each career move. Here are   some tips:<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p style="margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:18.0pt;background:white;vertical-align:baseline;font-stretch: inherit;box-sizing: border-box;orphans: auto;text-align:start;widows: auto;-webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;word-spacing:0px">  <strong><span style="font-family:inherit;color:#4D4F51;border:none windowtext 1.0pt;padding:0in">1) Figure which of your skills is the biggest aspirin to an employers pain.<o:p></o:p></span></strong></p>  <p style="margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:18.0pt;background:white;vertical-align:baseline">  <strong><span style="font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:#4D4F51;border:none windowtext 1.0pt;padding:0in;font-weight:normal">Companies</span></strong><span style="font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:#4D4F51"> hire new employees to solve problems.   There's a reason that position is open. Find out the importance of the job to the company's bottom line and show them you understand the value the right candidate needs to bring to the role. The more you can show you will fully alleviate their pain (and then   some!), the more attractive you are.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p style="margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:18.0pt;background:white;vertical-align:baseline;font-stretch: inherit;box-sizing: border-box;orphans: auto;text-align:start;widows: auto;-webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;word-spacing:0px">  <strong><span style="font-family:inherit;color:#4D4F51;border:none windowtext 1.0pt;padding:0in">2) Make sure you understand the impact each job change has on your life.<o:p></o:p></span></strong></p>  <p style="margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:18.0pt;background:white;vertical-align:baseline">  <strong><span style="font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:#4D4F51;border:none windowtext 1.0pt;padding:0in;font-weight:normal">Some</span></strong><span style="font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:#4D4F51"> of the jobs you'll encounter will offer   you a lot of hazard pay to do tough things. If you are up for the challenge, go for it. But, know that you won't be able to do those emotionally and physically challenging jobs long-term. It's just too hard on the other areas of your life. Be strategic in   which roles you take and why. The money isn't the only factor to consider!<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p style="margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:18.0pt;background:white;vertical-align:baseline;font-stretch: inherit;box-sizing: border-box;orphans: auto;text-align:start;widows: auto;-webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;word-spacing:0px">  <strong><span style="font-family:inherit;color:#4D4F51;border:none windowtext 1.0pt;padding:0in">3) Bank some serious cash.</span></strong><span class="apple-converted-space"><span style="font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:#4D4F51">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>  <p style="margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:18.0pt;background:white;vertical-align:baseline">  <span style="font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:#4D4F51">When my salary started going up fast, my spending didn't go up with it. My husband and I banked a lot of cash and used it later to support us when I walked away to start over in my career.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p style="margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:18.0pt;background:white;vertical-align:baseline;font-stretch: inherit;box-sizing: border-box;orphans: auto;text-align:start;widows: auto;-webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;word-spacing:0px">  <strong><span style="font-family:inherit;color:#4D4F51;border:none windowtext 1.0pt;padding:0in">4) Make a lot of career friends along the way.</span></strong><span class="apple-converted-space"><span style="font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:#4D4F51">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>  <p style="margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:18.0pt;background:white;vertical-align:baseline">  <span style="font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:#4D4F51">Networking with past and present colleagues gets even more important now. Create a strong professional reputation for yourself. Don't burn any bridges. When you quit, do it right. Had I not built   up a strong network and stayed in good standing with them during those years, I wouldn't have been able to tap into them later when I was launching a new career and business. My very first consulting gig was with a former employer!<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p style="margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:18.0pt;background:white;vertical-align:baseline;font-stretch: inherit;box-sizing: border-box;orphans: auto;text-align:start;widows: auto;-webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;word-spacing:0px">  <strong><span style="font-family:inherit;color:#4D4F51;border:none windowtext 1.0pt;padding:0in">5) Work for companies with a great story, brand, and reputation.</span></strong><span class="apple-converted-space"><span style="font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:#4D4F51">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>  <p style="margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:18.0pt;background:white;vertical-align:baseline">  <span style="font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:#4D4F51">When you work for companies that tell great stories about themselves and have compelling missions, you'll find they attract a better level of talent. These are the kinds of peers you want to work   with now - smart, savvy professionals who you can also see yourself working with again in the future (see #4). Plus, companies with good reputations and exciting stories make it easy for you to market yourself to other employers in the future.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p style="margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:18.0pt;background:white;vertical-align:baseline;font-stretch: inherit;box-sizing: border-box;orphans: auto;text-align:start;widows: auto;-webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;word-spacing:0px">  <strong><span style="font-family:inherit;color:#4D4F51;border:none windowtext 1.0pt;padding:0in">6) Know when to move on. (Hint: Do it while you're still top of your game).</span></strong><span class="apple-converted-space"><span style="font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:#4D4F51">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>  <p style="margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:18.0pt;background:white;vertical-align:baseline">  <span style="font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:#4D4F51">The moment you get complacent or start to lose your edge, you need to find your next move, either internally or externally. If your job satisfaction is declining, you can't let that linger just   because you are making good money. You need to identify that next project, skill, accomplishment or career move you need to take so you can stay engaged and satisfied. It's how you stay relevant and valuable to employers. Most importantly, it's how to stay   happy in your career and life. A great example of this is my colleague, Michael Peggs, who recently quit working at Google with a video.</span><span class="apple-converted-space"><span style="font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:#4D4F51">&nbsp;</span></span><span style="font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:#4D4F51"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20141009013358-7668018-saying-i-quit-to-google-hint-go-epic?trk=mp-reader-card" target="_blank"><span style="font-family:inherit;color:#7B539D;border:none windowtext 1.0pt;padding:0in">See   the video here - you will love it!</span></a><o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p style="margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:18.0pt;background:white;vertical-align:baseline;font-stretch: inherit;box-sizing: border-box;orphans: auto;text-align:start;widows: auto;-webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;word-spacing:0px">  <strong><span style="font-family:inherit;color:#4D4F51;border:none windowtext 1.0pt;padding:0in">If you made it to the bottom of this post, here's some good news!</span></strong><span style="font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:#4D4F51"><o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p style="mso-margin-top-alt:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:22.5pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:18.0pt;background:white;vertical-align:baseline;font-stretch: inherit;box-sizing: border-box;orphans: auto;text-align:start;widows: auto;-webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;word-spacing:0px">  <span style="font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:#4D4F51">Not everyone has the patience or desire to figure out how to profit professionally from the coming hiring boom. That's your competitive advantage. Don't lose momentum! Keep seeking information   and resources to help you. While it's not rocket science, it's not child's play either. The more you know, the more strategic you can be. Good luck and I wish you the best!<o:p></o:p></span></p>  </div>  </div>
