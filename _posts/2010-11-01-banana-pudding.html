  <div><DIV>  <DIV class=sanjineiwen>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Anytime I   see banana pudding on a menu, I'm filled with an euphoric sense of well being   and taken back to a special moment in my life when I learned an important lesson   about jealousy and love.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>It all   began when my stepchildren came for a visit shortly after their father and I   were married. Cheryl was 8, and Chuck was 10. Our small apartment soon became an   obstacle course littered with stuffed animals, toys, and games.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>But I   liked the kids from the start. They were everything I could have wanted in a son   and daughter.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Of course,   I wanted to win them over. They seemed to like me well enough, but I wasn't   sure, especially at mealtime. Cheryl, in particular, enjoyed watching me prepare   the evening meal and shadowed my every move in the kitchen. She had an   insatiable curiosity combined with an enchanting, yet somewhat disconcerting,   honesty.</FONT></P>  <P align=right><FONT face=Arial><IMG style="WIDTH: 380px; HEIGHT: 253px"   id=2334159 title="" border=0 alt="Banana pudding 用爱烘焙的香蕉布丁" align=right   src="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/language_tips/book/attachement/jpg/site1/20100401/0013729e41a90d1e5bfb19.jpg"   md5="" sourcedescription="编辑提供的本地文件" sourcename="本地文件"></FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"Whatcha   doing?" she asked.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"Making   potato salad," I replied.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>She stood   on her tiptoes and scrutinized the bowls of chopped pickles, eggs, and onions.   Her lips curled in disgust. She pointed at the bowls. "What's that? And that ...   and that!"</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>My answers   did not seem to please her. She shook her head in disapproval. "My mama doesn't   make it that way," she informed me.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"Well,   just taste it at dinner," I countered, smiling thinly to mask my irritation. "If   you don't like it, you don't have to eat it."</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>It became   a nightly ritual. Unfortunately, her father believed that children should eat   everything on their plate, including a sample of any dreaded dish that their   mother made in a different way than I did.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>As a   result, I started to feel like Snow White's wicked stepmother, plotting against   the princess as I willed her to succumb to my culinary magic. Chuck, who at   first ate anything and everything, developed critical tendencies. He soon took   up the hue and cry of "Mama doesn't make it that way."</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Each night   after dinner, we sat on the sofa with Dad in the middle, a child on each side,   and me on the outside. It seemed appropriate. I was feeling more and more like   an outcast.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>One night   while wrestling with his father on the sofa, Chuck found some stray popcorn   kernels under the cushions. Cheryl chastised me, saying that her mama always   vacuumed under their sofa seats every week.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>By this   time, I was developing a serious dislike both for her mother and her   methods.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Then, at   last, I found a dish their mama didn't make � one both the kids liked � banana   pudding. They helped me in the kitchen. Chuck beat the egg whites for the   topping while Cheryl carefully lined the pan with vanilla wafers. I cut up the   bananas and prepared the filling. They both licked the bowl. We all had fun. It   was a time of sharing and laughter.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Later,   making banana pudding became a cherished family tradition.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>On the   last night before they were to return home, we had arranged a family   get-together. When the doorbell rang, Cheryl scampered to answer. My   sister-in-law Carol stood framed in the doorway with a large bowl clutched in   her hands. "What's that?" Cheryl immediately wanted to know.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>"It's   banana pudding," Carol offered proudly.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Cheryl   took a closer look, then shook her head from side to side and said, "Karen   doesn't make it that way."</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>I   dissolved in laughter that no one else understood. Suddenly, my tension and   anxiety disappeared, and I knew that when those kids got back home, their mother   would be hearing a lot about how "Karen doesn't do it that way." She had my   sympathy and respect.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>It seemed   their mom and I had more in common than I thought, we both used one important   ingredient in our cooking, the most active one �   love.</FONT></P></DIV></DIV></div>
