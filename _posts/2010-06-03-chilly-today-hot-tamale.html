  <div><DIV>  <P><FONT face=Arial>"It's my own fault." Carl Fenter tugged his jacket closer   against the abnormal bite of cold morning wind. "The rest of the family is home,   where it's warm."</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>Just another one of his brilliant ideas - a big tamale feast   after tonight's Christmas Eve service at church - and look where it landed him:   waiting in a line&nbsp;50 people deep.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>Who would've guessed that every tamale shop in the city   would be sold out the day before Christmas? But they were, as Carl knew. He'd   been driving all over El Paso that morning. Determined to bring home the   tamales, Carl tried one last tienda, an old favorite out in   Canutillo.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>When he arrived, a fresh batch was due off the steamer in 45   minutes. Taking his place at the end of the snaking line of tamale-seekers, he   watched the woman in front of him remove her jacket to drape around her   shivering youngster. It wasn't long before she, too, shuddered in the chilly   wind. After only a moment's hesitation, Carl shed his own jacket and offered it   to the grateful mother.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>Together, they cheered when the line crept forward at last,   and smiling people exited the shop toting steamy bags. Finally, Carl got inside   the door and inched his way closer to the counter, the woman now first in   line.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>"Sorry folks," the clerk announced, "that's the last of the   tamales."</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>"No way!" Carl groaned with everyone else lined up behind   him.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>"But," stressed the man at the counter, "we'll have a final   batch ready in, oh, about two hours."</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>Defeated, Carl backed away, but the young mother grabbed his   arm.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>"You're leaving?"</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>"I have to," Carl glanced at his watch. "I promised to put   up luminarias at my church."</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>"I'll get your order of tamales and bring them to your   house."</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>Carl's brow furrowed. "I couldn't ask you to do   that."</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>"But it's the least I can do. You lent me your coat." Her   smile overrode his objections. "Just give me your address." She and her little   girl settled in for the long wait.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Arial>And at exactly noon on Christmas Eve, they delivered four   dozen fragrant tamales - along with Carl's brown jacket - to his   home.</FONT></P></DIV></div>
