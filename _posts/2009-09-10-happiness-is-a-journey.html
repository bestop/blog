  <div class="post"><h2>{{ page.title }}</h2><strong>{{ page.date | date_to_long_string }}</strong><div><DIV class=3jbiaoti>We always convince ourselves that life will be better after   we get married, have a baby, than another. Then we are frustrated that the kids   aren't old enough and we'll be more content when they are. After that we're   frustrated that we have teenagers to deal with. we will certainly be happy when   they are out of that stage.<IMG border=0 hspace=0 align=right   src="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/language_tips/att/site1/20070426/xin_210404261359111125593.jpg"   zmxid="zoomXimageId7" md5=""><BR><BR>We always tell ourselves that our life will   be complete when our spouse gets his or her act together. when we get a nice   car, and are able to go on a nice vocation when we retire. The truth is, there's   no better time than right now. If not now, when? our life will always be filled   with challenges. It's best to admit this to ourselves and decide to be happy   anyway.</DIV>  <DIV class=3jineiwen>  <P>One of my favorite quotes comes from Alfred Souza. He said."for a long time   it had seemed to me that life was about to begin-real life. But there was always   some obstacle in the way, someting to be gotten through first, some unfinished   business, time still to be served, a debt to be paid.</P>  <P>Then life would begin. At last it dawned on me that these obstacles were my   life." This perspective has helped me to see that there is no way to happiness.   Happiness is the way. So treasure every moment that you have.</P>  <P>And remember that time waits for no one. So stop waiting until you finish   school, until you go back to school; until you get married, until you get   divorced; until you have kids; until you retire; until you get a new car or   home; until spring; until you are born again to decide that there is no better   time than right now to be happy….</P>  <P>Happiness is a journey, not a destination.So, work like you don't need money,   love like you've never been hurt, And dance like no one's   watching.<BR></P></DIV>  <DIV><FONT size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV></div>
