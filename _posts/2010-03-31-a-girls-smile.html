One day while working at the cash register in the   gift shop, I saw an elderly couple come in with a little girl in a   wheelchair.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>As I looked closer at this   girl, I saw that she was kind of perched on her chair. I then realized she had   no arms or legs, just a head, neck and torso. She was wearing a little white   dress with red polka dots.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>As the couple wheeled her up to   me I was looking down at the register. I turned my head toward the girl and gave   her a wink. As I took the money from her grandparents, I looked back at the   girl, who was giving me the cutest, largest smile I have ever seen.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>All of a sudden her handicap   was gone and all I saw was this beautiful girl, whose smile just melted me and   almost instantly gave me a completely new sense of what life is all about. She   took me from a poor, unhappy college student and brought me into her world; a   world of smiles, love and warmth.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>That was ten years ago. I'm a   successful business person now and whenever I get down and think about the   troubles of the world, I think about that little girl and the remarkable lesson   about life that she taught me.</FONT></P></DIV></DIV>.5</div>
