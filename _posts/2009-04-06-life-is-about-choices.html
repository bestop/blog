  <div><P   style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px; TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt">迈克尔是个天生的乐天派，他总是能保持良好的情绪，总是能说出很多积极的话来。他也让我懂得了一个道理，那就是人生中的每一天我们都可以选择充实地生活，态度决定一切。</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px; TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt">Michael is the kind of guy   you love to hate. He is always in a good mood and always has something positive   to say. When someone would ask him how he was doing, he would reply, "If I were   any better, I'd be twins!" He was a natural motivator.</P>  <P align=left>If an employee was having a bad day, Michael was there telling the   employee how to look on the positive side of the situation. Seeing this style   really made me curious, so one day I went up to Michael and asked him, "I don' t   get it. You can' t be positive all the time. How do you do it?"</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px; TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt">Michael replied, each   morning I wake up and say to myself 'Mike, you have two choices today. You can   choose to be in a good mood or you can choose to be in a bad mood.' I choose to   be in a good mood. Each time something bad happens, I can choose to be a victim   or choose to learn from it. I choose to learn from it. Every time someone comes   to me complaining I can choose to accept their complaining or I can point out   the positive side of life. I choose the positive side of life."</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px; TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt">"Yeah, right. It isn't that   easy." I protested.</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px; TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt">"Yes it is, " Michael said.   "Life is all about choices. When you cut away all the junk, every situation is a   choice. You choose how you react to situations. You choose how people will   affect your mood. You choose to be in a good mood or bad mood. The bottom line   is: It's your choice how you live life. " I reflected on what Michael said.</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px; TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt">Soon thereafter, I left the   big enterprise that I had worked in for years to start my own business. We lost   touch, but I often though about him when I made a choice about life instead of   reacting to it. Several years later, I heard Michael was involved in a serious   accident, falling off 60 feet from a communications tower.</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px; TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt">After l8 hours of surgery,   and weeks of intensive care, Michael was released from the hospital with rods   placed in his back. I saw Michael about six months after the accident. When I   asked him how he was, he replied, "If I were any better, I'd be twins. Wanna see   my scars?" I declined to see his wounds, but did ask him what had gone through   his mind as the accident took place.</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px; TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt">"The first thing that went   through my mind was the well being of my soon-to-born daughter," Michael   replied. "Then, as I lay on the ground, remembered I had two choices: I could   choose to live or I could choose to die. I chose to live." "Weren't you scared?   Did you lose consciousness?" I asked. Michael continued, "... the paramedics   were great. They kept telling me I was going to be fine. But when they wheeled   me into the operation room and I saw the expressions on the faces of the doctors   and nurses, I got really scared. In their eyes, l read 'He's a dead man.' I knew   I needed to take action." "What did you do?" I asked. "Well, there was a big   burly nurse shouting questions at me" said Michael. "She asked me if I was   allergic to anything. 'Yes,' I said. The doctors and nurses stopped working as   they waited for my reply. I took a deep breath and yelled", 'Gravity'" Over   their laughter, I told them, 'I'm choosing to live. Operate on me as if I am   alive, not dead'."</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px; TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt">Michael lived, thanks to the   skill of his doctors, but also because of his amazing attitude.</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px; TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt">I learned from him that   every day we have a choice to live fully. Attitude is everything.</P>  <DIV><FONT size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV></div>
