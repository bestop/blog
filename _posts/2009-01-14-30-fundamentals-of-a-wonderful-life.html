  <div class="post"><h2>{{ page.title }}</h2><strong>{{ page.date | date_to_long_string }}</strong><div><div class="Section1" style="LAYOUT-GRID:  15.6pt none"><p><span style="font-family:宋体;"><span lang="EN-US">Recently I had my first golf lesson with a professional golfer. Now, this is not the first time that I had played golf - I picked up a golf club for the first time approximately 9 months ago and subsequently played on and off with friends. I studied a few golf books and received a few good tips from my friends, but frustration finally sent me in search of professional help.<?xml:namespace prefix = o /><o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p><span style="font-family:宋体;"><span lang="EN-US">At the lesson, the first thing I did was hit some golf balls whilst the coach watched. Then, he told me this: “first, we are going to work on the 4 fundamentals of golf: grip, stance, posture, and alignment”. If you think about each of them - grip, stance, posture, and alignment - you can imagine why it was that I did not hit too many golf balls in that first lesson. The swing - that all important element that is the final determinant of how the ball is hit - would not be the focus until I had the fundamentals under control.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p><span style="font-family:宋体;"><span lang="EN-US">This golf lesson got me thinking. It seems to me that there are certain fundamentals not only in golf, but in life, that we should have under control before we turn our attention to loftier ambitions. For example, many people who desire wealth will begin investing (the swing) without developing any financial intelligence (the fundamentals).<br /><br /><span id="more-303"></span>For the non-golfers out there, another great metaphor is the construction of your dream home. Imagine you are wanting to build a beautiful, multi-level home (your life). Once the site is prepared and you are ready to build, the first step is the laying of the foundation (the fundamentals). It is crucial that this foundation is strong, for if it is upon this that the rest of the house is built.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p><span style="font-family:宋体;"><span lang="EN-US">Here then are what I consider to be 30 fundamentals of a wonderful life. Yes -I’m sure there are more, but if you can manage to get each of these under control you will have a strong foundation upon which to build a wonderful life.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p><h3><strong><b><span style="font-family:宋体;"><span lang="EN-US"  style="font-family:宋体;"><a href="http://www.thechangeblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/success.jpg"></a></span></span></b></strong><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-size:100%;">Success<o:p></o:p></span></span></h3><p><strong><b><span style="font-family:宋体;"><span lang="EN-US"  style="font-family:宋体;">Defining what success means to YOU: </span></span></b></strong><span lang="EN-US"><a title="what is success" href="http://www.thechangeblog.com/2007/10/09/what-is-success/" target="_self">success</a> will mean different things to different people. In these modern times, traditional ideas of success involving impressive job titles and high salaries are being challenged by such ideas as “time affluence”. Decide what is important to you, and don’t waste time chasing someone else’s idea of success.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p><strong><b><span style="font-family:宋体;"><span lang="EN-US"  style="font-family:宋体;">Strong work ethic:</span></span></b></strong><span lang="EN-US"> expecting great success without being willing to work hard for it is a recipe for mediocrity. If it seems that others just get lucky, remember the following quote from the famous golfer Gary Player:<o:p></o:p></span></p><p><span style="font-family:宋体;"><span lang="EN-US">“The harder I work, the luckier I get.” - Gary Player<o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p id="google_ads" style="FLOAT: right"><strong><b><span style="font-family:宋体;"><span lang="EN-US"  style="font-family:宋体;">Focus on adding value:</span></span></b></strong><span lang="EN-US"> stop focusing on what you <em><i><span style="font-family:宋体;"><span style="font-family:宋体;">want</span></span></i></em>, and start thinking of how you can <em><i><span style="font-family:宋体;"><span style="font-family:宋体;">add value</span></span></i></em> to other people. When you help other people get what they want, they will be more willing to help you.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p><strong><b><span style="font-family:宋体;"><span lang="EN-US"  style="font-family:宋体;">Abundance mentality: </span></span></b></strong><span lang="EN-US">this is the understanding that there is plenty out there and enough to spare for everybody. With this mentality, you are willing to share prestige, recognition, and profits.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p><strong><b><span style="font-family:宋体;"><span lang="EN-US"  style="font-family:宋体;">Motivation: </span></span></b></strong><span lang="EN-US">what drives you to succeed? When you understand the reasons behind what you do (eg to provide for your family), you will gain purpose and clarity.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p><strong><b><span style="font-family:宋体;"><span lang="EN-US"  style="font-family:宋体;">Goals: </span></span></b></strong><span lang="EN-US">there have been numerous studies that have shown people who set goals are more likely to succeed than people who do not. By setting goals, you focus your attention on a target which, in turn, focuses your mind on finding ways to get there.<o:p></o:p></span></p><h3><b><span style="font-family:宋体;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-size:100%;">Personal Growth<o:p></o:p></span></span></span></b></h3><p><strong><b><span style="font-family:宋体;"><span lang="EN-US"  style="font-family:宋体;"><a href="http://www.thechangeblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/curious.jpg"></a>A curious mind: </span></span></b></strong><span lang="EN-US">a curious mind loves to learn new things. If you have ever <a href="http://www.thechangeblog.com/2007/08/25/6-lessons-from-my-6-month-old/">watched a small child play</a> you will know exactly what I mean. So instead of just accepting things “as is”, ask yourself the questions: <em><i><span style="font-family:宋体;"><span style="font-family:宋体;">What? How? Why? Who? When?</span></span></i></em><o:p></o:p></span></p><p><strong><b><span style="font-family:宋体;"><span lang="EN-US"  style="font-family:宋体;">An open mind:</span></span></b></strong><span lang="EN-US"> some of our beliefs and actions are so ingrained that we automatically disregard any evidence that we should think or act otherwise. Keep an open mind, and you may just come across a better way of seeing or doing things.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p><strong><b><span style="font-family:宋体;"><span lang="EN-US"  style="font-family:宋体;">A willingness to change:</span></span></b></strong><span lang="EN-US"> it is one thing to want to live a better life, but are you <em><i><span style="font-family:宋体;"><span style="font-family:宋体;">really</span></span></i></em> willing to make the necessary changes? The following quote explains this concept perfectly:<o:p></o:p></span></p><p><span style="font-family:宋体;"><span lang="EN-US">“The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results” - Albert Einstein<o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p><strong><b><span style="font-family:宋体;"><span lang="EN-US"  style="font-family:宋体;">Defining your values and principles:</span></span></b></strong><span lang="EN-US"> who are you? What are you about? And what do you value? If you don’t have one already, I highly recommend taking the time to write a <a href="http://www.thechangeblog.com/2007/08/09/how-a-personal-mission-statement-can-help-you-change/">personal mission statement</a>.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p><strong><b><span style="font-family:宋体;"><span lang="EN-US"  style="font-family:宋体;">Awareness: </span></span></b></strong><span lang="EN-US"><a href="http://www.thechangeblog.com/2007/09/05/5-signs-you-are-on-autopilot/">are you on autopilot?</a> If so, turn it off and decide to <em><i><span style="font-family:宋体;"><span style="font-family:宋体;">live consciously</span></span></i></em>. In short, this means to being committed to awareness as a way of existing in the world. Awareness of your beliefs, awareness of your own power, and awareness of your freedom to choose your own destiny.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p><strong><b><span style="font-family:宋体;"><span lang="EN-US"  style="font-family:宋体;">Self-discipline: </span></span></b></strong><span lang="EN-US">you may have the best intentions in the world, but without self-discipline you will fall victim to the temptation. If you have problems with self-discipline, burn the following quote into your memory and recall it whenever temptation arises:<o:p></o:p></span></p><p><span style="font-family:宋体;"><span lang="EN-US">“The price of discipline is always less than the pain of regret”<o:p></o:p></span></span></p><h3><b><span style="font-family:宋体;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-size:100%;">Happiness<strong><b><span style="font-family:宋体;"><span style="font-family:宋体;"><a href="http://www.thechangeblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/sunset.jpg"></a></span></span></b></strong><o:p></o:p></span></span></span></b></h3><p><strong><b><span style="font-family:宋体;"><span lang="EN-US"  style="font-family:宋体;">The ability to enjoy the now:</span></span></b></strong><span lang="EN-US"> it’s important to plan for the future, but too many people have “destination addiction” which means they can’t enjoy then present.

As they say, knowledge is power.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p><strong><b><span style="font-family:宋体;"><span lang="EN-US"  style="font-family:宋体;">Spend less than you earn: </span></span></b></strong><span lang="EN-US">to gain wealth, you must spend less than you earn.

It’s not a good feeling. There are circumstances where debt is good, but if you fall into the debt trap you can become a slave to making the repayments.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p><strong><b><span style="font-family:宋体;"><span lang="EN-US"  style="font-family:宋体;">Patience: </span></span></b></strong><span lang="EN-US">Without patience, you will be drawn towards high risk investments such as speculative stocks or get rich quick schemes. Sure there are some winners who get rich quick, but there are also a lot of people who get hurt (especially if they haven’t taken the time to develop their financial intelligence). Be prepared to <a href="http://www.getrichslowly.org/">get rich slowly</a>.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p><strong><b><span style="font-family:宋体;"><span lang="EN-US"  style="font-family:宋体;">Adequate protection of assets: </span></span></b></strong><span lang="EN-US">it is one thing to accumulate assets, but if they are not adequately protected you may be in for an unpleasant surprise.
