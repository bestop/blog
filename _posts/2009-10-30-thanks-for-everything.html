  <div><DIV><FONT size=2 face="Comic Sans MS">  <DIV class=user-face>In our life, we have rarely expressed our gratitude to the   one who'd lived those years with us. In fact, we don't have to wait for   anniversaries to thank the ones closet to us―the ones so easily overlooked. If I   have learned anything about giving thanks, it is this: give it now! while your   feeling of appreciation is alive and sincere, act on it. Saying thanks is such   an easy way to add to the world's happiness. <BR><BR>Saying thanks not only   brightens someone else's world, it brightens yours. If you're feeling left out,   unloved or unappreciated, try reaching out to others. It may be just the   medicine you need. <BR><BR>Of course, there are times when you can't express   gratitude immediately. In that case don't let embarrassment sink you into   silence-speak up the first time you have the chance. <BR><BR>Once a young   minister, Mark Brian, was sent to a remote parish of Kwakiutl Indians in British   Columbia. The Indians, he had been told, did not have a word for thank you. But   Brian soon found that these people had exceptional generosity. Instead of saying   thanks, it is their custom to return every favor with a favor of their own, and   every kindness with an equal or superior kindness. They do their thanks.   <BR><BR>I wonder if we had no words in our vocabulary for thank you, would we do   a better job of communicating our gratitude? Would we be more responsive, more   sensitive, more caring? <BR><BR>Thankfulness sets in motion a chain reaction   that transforms people all around us―including ourselves. For no one ever   misunderstands the melody of a grateful heart. Its message is universal; its   lyrics transcend all earthly barriers; its music touches the   heavens.</DIV></FONT></DIV></div>
