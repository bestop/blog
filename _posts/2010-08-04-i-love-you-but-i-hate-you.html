  <div><DIV class=sanjineiwen>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Yes   relationships.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>It is the   true test of how human we really are. How much we can accept in our fellow   humans. And really how much we want to accept. If we accept too much does that   make us strong. And if we don't accept enough does that make us weak. Or is it   the other way around?</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>All these   things are a true test of how much you are capable of loving.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>We all are   born into this world with one thought - I shall love and be loved.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>I am not   afraid of love I am afraid of what too much love for the wrong reasons can do.   It can make you into a person that you don't know you have become until it is   all-wrong.</FONT></P>  <P align=center><FONT face=Arial></FONT>  <DIV align=left><FONT face=Arial><IMG style="WIDTH: 388px; HEIGHT: 266px"   id=2142881 title="" border=0 alt="I love you but I hate you 爱恨交加" align=center   src="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/language_tips/book/attachement/jpg/site1/20100114/0013729e41a90cb914a62c.jpg"   md5="" sourcedescription="编辑提供的本地文件" sourcename="本地文件"></FONT></DIV>  <P><FONT face=Arial></FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Until the   day you look in the mirror and the reflection is not yours.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>We marry   our true love and then as time goes by we tend to lose whom we once were. And if   we can't find ourselves during this time of marriage then we become a shell that   will eventually crack. And your marriage will soon become a divorce   statistic.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Marriage is   commitment to the love you have for someone but it should not be the end of your   identity. Because if you let it then you will truly Love You But Hate   You.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Kahlil   Gibran best said it many years ago in <EM>The Prophet on   Marriage</EM>：</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>We need to   remember that I will love you but I will not become you. I will not allow us to   become one. Love when people are like meet my other half - what? And especially   when they throw in the humor meet my better half. It's there way of being all   happy and cute. But is it setting yourselves up for a relationship that in time   will fail? I guess it all depends on how independent of a person you were prior   to becoming one. And will losing your independence really be an   issue.</FONT></P>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.8pt; MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>So don't be   duped into the relationship tricks. Be yourself and enjoy your partner as   himself or herself not as you want them to be. Because you did fall in love with   them knowing who they are.</FONT></P></DIV></div>
