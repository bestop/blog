  <div><DIV>  <DIV class=sanjineiwen>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px">There was once a farmer who had a fine olive   orchard. He was very hardworking, and the farm always prospered under his care.   But he knew that his three sons despised the farm work, and were eager to make   wealth, trough adventure.</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px">When the farmer was old, and felt that his time   had come to die, he called the three sons to him and said, "My sons, there is a   pot of gold hidden in the olive orchard. Dig for it, if you wish it."</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px">The sons tried to get him to tell them in what   part of the orchard the gold was hidden; but he would tell them nothing   more.</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px">After the farmer was dead, the sons went to work   to find the pot of gold; since they did not know where the hiding-place was,   they agreed to begin in a line, at one end of the orchard, and to dig until one   of them should find the money.</P>  <P align=right><IMG style="WIDTH: 200px; HEIGHT: 262px" id=1011016 title=""   border=0 alt=果园里的金子 align=right   src="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/language_tips/book/attachement/jpg/site1/20080922/0013729e42d20a4135d703.jpg"   zmxid="zoomXimageId6" md5="" sourcedescription="编辑提供的本地文件"   sourcename="本地文件"></P>  <P></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px">They dug until they had turned up the soil from   one end of the orchard to the other, round the tree-roots and between them. But   no pot of gold was to be found. It seemed as if someone must have stolen it, or   as if the farmer had been wandering in his wits. The three sons were bitterly   disappointed to have all their work for nothing.</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px">The next olive season, the olive trees in the   orchard bore more fruit than they had ever given; when it was sold, it gave the   sons a whole pot of gold.</P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px">And when they saw how much money had come from   the orchard, they suddenly understood what the wise father had meant when he   said, "There is gold hidden in the orchard. Dig for it, if you wish   it."</P></DIV></DIV></div>
