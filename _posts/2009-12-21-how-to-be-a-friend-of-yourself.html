  <div><DIV>  <DIV class=sanjiriqi><FONT face=Arial>Friendship with oneself is all important,   because without it one cannot be friends with anyone else in the world.- Eleanor   Roosevelt</FONT></DIV>  <DIV class=sanjiriqi><FONT face=Arial></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV class=sanjineiwen>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>We often focus on building   relationships with others that we forget the essential first step: being friends   of ourselves. That is the crucial first step if we are to have good   relationships with others. How can we have good relationships with others if we   don't even have good relationship with ourselves?</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>The problem might be worse than   we expect. Maybe we don't like ourselves without realizing it. Here is a simple   checklist; is there anything you don't like about yourself from these   list?</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Your past</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Maybe you have made mistakes in   the past which you feel bad about. You might be disappointed with yourself on   why you could make such mistakes. Even if that happened in distant past, your   subconscious mind still has a reason not to like yourself.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Your background</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>You might wish that you were   born in different family, or that you have different background. Maybe you could   not accept the fact that you are not as lucky as others, who seem to get   whatever they want effortlessly because of their background.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Your personality   traits</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>You might have some personality   traits that you don't like. For example, you may be an introvert and you don't   like it; you wish you are an extrovert.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Your achievements relative to   others Others might have better achievements than you, and no matter how hard   you tried, it might seem impossible for you to match them. You might then think   that it's because you are not smart enough or don't have enough talents. Is   there anything that resonate with you? All these give reasons to you not to like   yourself. That in turn makes it difficult for you to be a good friend to   yourself.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Fortunately, there are always   things you can do to fix the situation. Here are some tips:</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>1. Forgive yourself</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>You may have made those   mistakes in the past, but is there anything you can do about them? I don't think   so, except learning from them. It's true that you are not perfect, but neither   is everybody else. It's normal to make mistakes, so do yourself a favor by   giving yourself forgiveness.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>2. Accept things you can't   change</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>There are some things you   cannot change, such as your background and your past. So learn to accept them.   You will feel much relieved if you treat things you can't change the way they   deserve: just accept them, smile, and move on.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>3. Focus on your   strengths</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Instead of focusing on your   weaknesses, focus on your strengths. You always have some strengths which give   you a unique combination nobody else have. Recognize your strengths and build   your life around them.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Health Top Tips Nutrition   Lifestyle</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>4. Write your success   stories</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>One reason we may not like   ourselves is we are too focused on what we don't have that we forget about what   we have. So make a list of your achievements; write your success stories. They   do not have to be big things; there are a lot of small but important   achievements in our life. For example, if you have some good friends, that's   already an achievement. If you have a good family, that is also an   achievement.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>5. Stop comparing yourself with   others</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>You are unique. You can never   be like other people, and neither can other people be like you. The way you   measure your success is not determined by other people and what they achieve.   Instead, it is determined by your own life purpose. You have everything you need   to achieve your life purpose, so it's useless to compare yourself with   others.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>6. Always be true to   yourself</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>You don't like other people   lying to you, right? Similarly, you won't like yourself if you know that you lie   to yourself. Whether you realize it or not, that gives your mind a reason not to   like yourself. That's why it's important to always be true to yourself. In   whatever you do, be honest and follow your conscience. Remember this quote by   Abraham Lincoln:</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>I desire so to conduct the   affairs of this administration that if at the end . . . I have lost every other   friend on earth, I shall at least have one friend left, and that friend shall be   down inside of me.</FONT></P></DIV></DIV></div>
