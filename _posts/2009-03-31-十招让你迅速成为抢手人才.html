  <div><DIV><FONT size=2><FONT size=3>The current economy has made job-hunting a vital   skill set for increasing numbers of people. But even in the best of economic   times, it pays to understand what you can do to make yourself more appealingin   the marketplace. <BR>　　 <BR>　　Current career trends suggest that an individual   will change careers at least 7 times during a lifetime. This reality presents   the opportunity to fulfill several of our aspirations. No longer do we have to   choose only one road. Instead, we can visualize a broader map, and believe that   we will likely come across those other roads somewhere down the line. <BR>　　   <BR>　　 <BR>　　Increasing marketability is a sure way of being more prepared for a   career change. The following are ten strategies for sharpening skills and   increasing marketability: <BR>　　 <BR>　　 <BR>　　1. Visualize. 想象 <BR>　　 <BR>　　   <BR>　　Set aside some time to think about where you are in life, and where you   want to be. Are you happy? What parts of your career excite you, and what   frustrates you? Where do you want to be in five years? In ten? Give yourself   permissionto dream. <BR>　　 <BR>　　 <BR>　　2. Take Inventory. 制作清单 <BR>　　 <BR>　　   <BR>　　What activities are you currently doing, both on the job and in your   leisure time? What skills do they require? How would you rate your skills? Which   ones need improving? How could you sharpen them? Which skills do you enjoy   using, and which skills do you wish you used more often? <BR>　　 <BR>　　 <BR>　　3.   Update your resume. 更新你的简历 <BR>　　 <BR>　　 <BR>　　Regularly update your resume.   Visiting a local career center or scanning current resume books can keep your   resume looking polished. You also may want to have resumes that highlight   different skills. For example, you might have one specifically for management   positions, and another for advertising positions. Also, keep hard copies of your   resume close at hand and give it out freely. <BR>　　 <BR>　　 <BR>　　4. Attend   Workshops. 参加培训 <BR>　　 <BR>　　 <BR>　　Take advantage of workshops offered by your   employer. Dare to go to a training session that doesnt "exactly fit" your job.   For example, if your job requires computer skills, in addition to   computer-related workshops, consider attending a workshop on leadership. If your   organization doesnt offer workshops, consider taking a course at a local   community college. <BR>　　 <BR>　　 <BR>　　5. Cross-train. 交叉性训练 <BR>　　 <BR>　　   <BR>　　Make your current job more interesting and enhance your skills at the same   time by varying your job responsibilities. Continuously hone your skills that   are transferable to other positions, corporations, and even career fields.   Always be quick to volunteer for opportunities to learn different skills. <BR>　　   <BR>　　 <BR>　　6. Join committees. 参加协会 <BR>　　 <BR>　　 <BR>　　Committees are a great   way to network and to improve skills. Vary the committees on which you serve.   Chair (成为领导者) a committee. Choose to be on a committee that will challenge you   intellectually, emotionally, skill-wise, etc. In other words, make a decision to   grow. <BR>　　 <BR>　　 <BR>　　7. Do something different. 做些不同寻常的事情 <BR>　　 <BR>　　   <BR>　　Been doing the same thing for years? Maybe now is the time for change. Try   something youve always wanted to do, but for whatever reason, havent yet. Youll   learn more about yourself, enhance skills, make contacts, and feel alive again.   <BR>　　 <BR>　　 <BR>　　8. Make new contacts, strengthen the old. 结识新朋友，不忘老朋友 <BR>　　   <BR>　　 <BR>　　Networking is the primaryway people get interviews. View every   opportunity as a networking one. The goal isnt to determine, "What can this   person do for me," but finding out what you and the other person have to offer   each other. Form and maintain relationships at work, through your family, in   social organizations, and in your community. Remember, you will need to nurture   relationships through staying in touch with your contacts, sending cards, be   alert to interesting articles, and other "thinking of you" activities. <BR>　　   <BR>　　 <BR>　　9. Volunteer. 志愿者工作 <BR>　　 <BR>　　 <BR>　　 <BR>　　Volunteering can   expand your network and enhance skills. Its also an easy way to try out some of   your career aspirations. Considering a career change that will take you out of   the corporate world and into the lives of kids? Try volunteering at your local   school. Theres no career risk, just a chance to grow, learn about yourself and   give back to your community. <BR>　　 <BR>　　 <BR>　　10. Create a Marketability   Plan. 制作一份推销计划 <BR>　　 <BR>　　 <BR>　　Perhaps the most important suggestion is to   create a marketability plan. Take a good, hard look at yourself. Ask yourself   the tough questions. "If I were an employer, would I hire me?" Make a plan to   increase your marketability. Which of these activities could you commit to   trying in the next month? Set a goal and a time-line, and get started!   </FONT><BR></FONT></DIV></div>
