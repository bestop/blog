  <div>"We are reading the first verse of the first chapter of a   book whose pages are infinite---" <BR><BR>I do not know who wrote those words,   but I have always liked them as a reminder that the future can be anything we   want to make it. We can take the mysterious, hazy future and carve out of it   anything that we can imagine, just like a sculptor carves a statue from a   shapeless stone. <BR><BR>We are all in the position of the farmer. If we plant a   good seed, we reap a good harvest. If our seed is poor and full of weeds, we   reap a useless crop. If we plant nothing at all, we harvest nothing at all.   <BR><BR>I want the future to be better than the past. I don't want it   contaminated by the mistakes and errors with which history is filled. We should   all be concerned about the future because that is where we will spend the   reminder of our lives. <BR><BR>The past is gone and static. Nothing we can do   will change it. The future is before us and dynamic. Everything we do will   effect it. Each day will brings with it new frontiers, in our homes and in our   businesses, if we will only recognize them. We are just at the beginning of the   progress in every field of human endeavor. <BR>  <DIV><FONT size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV></div>
