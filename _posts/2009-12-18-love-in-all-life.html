Don't go for looks; they can deceive. Don't   go for wealth, even that fades away. Go for someone who makes you smile because   it takes only a smile to make a dark day seem bright.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Dream what you want to dream;   go where you want to go; be what you want to be, because you have only one life   and one chance to do all the things you want to do.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Always put yourself in the   other's shoes. If you feel that it hurts you, it probably hurts the person   too.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>A careless word may kindle   strife; a cruel word may wreck a life; a timely word may level stress; a loving   word may heal and bless.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>The happiest of people don't   necessarily have the best of everything they just make the most of everything   that comes along their way.</FONT></P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px"><FONT face=Arial>Love begins with a smile, grows   with a kiss, ends with a tear. When you were born, you were crying and everyone   around you was smiling. Live your life so that when you die, you're the one   smiling and everyone around you is crying.</FONT></P></DIV></DIV></div>
