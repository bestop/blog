	<span style="font-family:Arial;">Marcus Aurelius</span>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="background:white;">
		<i><span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:Arial;">“Let us be grateful to people who make us happy, they are the charming gardeners who make our souls blossom.”</span></i><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;color:#111111;"><br />
<b><span style="font-family:Arial;">Marcel Proust</span></b></span>
	</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="background:white;">
		<span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:Arial;">Circumstances can certainly make life unhappy. But a part – often a big part – of unhappiness comes from our own thinking, behavior and habits.</span>
	</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="background:white;">
		<span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:Arial;">In this article I’d like to share 7 of the most destructive daily habits&nbsp;that can create quite a bit of unhappiness within and in your own little world.</span>
	</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="background:white;">
		<span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:Arial;">But I’ll also share what has worked, what has helped me to minimize or overcome these habits in my life.</span>
	</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="background:white;">
		<b><span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:Arial;">1. Aiming for perfection.</span></b><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;color:#111111;"></span>
	</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="background:white;">
		<span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:Arial;">Does life has to be perfect before you are happy?</span>
	</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="background:white;">
		<span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:Arial;">Do you have to behave in a perfect way and get perfect results to be happy?</span>
	</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="background:white;">
		<span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:Arial;">Then happiness will not be easy to find. Setting the bar for your performance at an inhuman level usually leads to low self-esteem and feeling like you are not good enough even though   you may have had a lot of good or excellent results. You and what you do is never enough good enough except maybe once in a while when feels like something goes just perfect.</span>
	</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="background:white;">
		<b><span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:Arial;">How to overcome this habit:</span></b><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;color:#111111;"></span>
	</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="background:white;">
		<span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:Arial;">Three things that helped me to kick the perfectionism habit and become more relaxed:</span>
	</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:15.0pt;text-indent:-.25in;background:white;">
		<!--[if !supportLists]--><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Wingdings;color:#111111;"><span><span style="font-family:Arial;">§</span><span style="font-family:Arial;">&nbsp; </span></span></span><!--[endif]--><b><span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:Arial;">Go for good enough.</span></b><span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:Arial;">&nbsp;Aiming for perfection usually winds up in   a project or something else never being finished. So go for good enough instead. Don’t use it as an excuse to slack off. But simply realize that there is something called good enough and when you are there then you are finished with whatever you are doing.</span>
	</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:15.0pt;text-indent:-.25in;background:white;">
		<!--[if !supportLists]--><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Wingdings;color:#111111;"><span><span style="font-family:Arial;">§</span><span style="font-family:Arial;">&nbsp; </span></span></span><!--[endif]--><b><span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:Arial;">Have a deadline.&nbsp;</span></b><span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:Arial;">I set deadlines every time that start with a   new premium guide. Because about a year ago, when I was working on my second e-book, I realized that just working on it and releasing it when it was done would not work. Because I could always find stuff to add to it. So I had to set a deadline. Setting a   deadline gave me a kick in the butt and it is generally good way to help you to let go of a need to polish things a bit too much.</span>
	</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:15.0pt;text-indent:-.25in;background:white;">
		<!--[if !supportLists]--><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Wingdings;color:#111111;"><span><span style="font-family:Arial;">§</span><span style="font-family:Arial;">&nbsp; </span></span></span><!--[endif]--><b><span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:Arial;">Realize what it costs you when you buy into myths of perfection.</span></b><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;color:#111111;"><span style="font-family:Arial;">This   was a very powerful reason for me to let go of perfectionism and one I tell myself still if I find thoughts of perfection pop up in my mind. By watching too many movies, listening to too many songs and just taking in what the world is telling you it is very   easy to be lulled into dreams of perfection. It sounds so good and wonderful and you want it.</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Arial;"> But in real life it clashes with reality and tends to cause much suffering and stress within you and in the people around you. It can harm or possibly lead you to end relationships, jobs, projects etc. just because your expectations are out of this world. I   find it very helpful to remind myself of this simple fact.</span></span>
	</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="background:white;">
		<b><span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:Arial;">2. Living in a sea of negative voices.</span></b><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;color:#111111;"></span>
	</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="background:white;">
		<span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:Arial;">No one is an island. Who we socialize with, what we read, watch and listen to has big effect on how we feel and think.</span>
	</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="background:white;">
		<span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:Arial;">It becomes a lot harder to be happier if you let yourself be dragged down by negative voices. Voices that tell you that life will in large part always be unhappy, dangerous and filled   with fear and limits. Voices that watch life from a negative perspective.</span>
	</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="background:white;">
		<b><span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:Arial;">How to overcome this habit:</span></b><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;color:#111111;"></span>
	</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="background:white;">
		<span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:Arial;">Replacing those negative voices with more positive influences is very powerful. It can be like a whole new world opening up.</span>
	</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="background:white;">
		<span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:Arial;">So spend more time with positive people, inspiring music and books, movies and TV-shows that make you laugh and think about life in a new way.</span>
	</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="background:white;">
		<span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:Arial;">You can start small. For example, try reading an uplifting blog or book or listen to an audio book while eating your breakfast one morning this week instead of reading the paper or watching   the morning news on TV.</span>
	</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="background:white;">
		<b><span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:Arial;">3. Getting stuck in the past and future too much.</span></b><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;color:#111111;"></span>
	</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="background:white;">
		<span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:Arial;">Spending much of your time in the past and reliving old painful memories, conflicts, missed opportunities and so on can hurt whole lot. Spending much of your time in the future and imagining   how things could go wrong at work, in your relationships and with your health can build into horrifying nightmare scenarios playing over and over in your head. Not being here right now in life as it happens can lead to missing out on a lot of wonderful experiences.</span>
	</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="background:white;">
		<span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:Arial;">No good if you want to be happier.</span>
	</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="background:white;">
		<b><span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:Arial;">How to overcome this habit:</span></b><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;color:#111111;"></span>
	</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="background:white;">
		<span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:Arial;">It is pretty much impossible to not think about the past or the future. And it is of course important to plan for tomorrow and next year and to try to learn from your past.</span>
	</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="background:white;">
		<span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:Arial;">But to dwell on those things rarely help.</span>
	</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="background:white;">
		<span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:Arial;">So I try as best as I can to spend the rest of my time, the big part of my time each day, with living in the now. Just being here right now and being fully focused on these words I am   writing and later as I cook and eat my lunch and work out be fully focused on doing that.</span>
	</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="background:white;">
		<span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:Arial;">Whatever I am doing I try to be there fully and not drift off into the future or past.</span>
	</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="background:white;">
		<span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:Arial;">If I do drift off then I focus only on my breathing for a few minutes or I sit still and take in what is all around me right now with all my senses for a short while. By doing either   of those things I can realign myself with the present moment again.</span>
	</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="background:white;">
		<b><span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:Arial;">4. Comparing yourself and your life to others and their lives.</span></b><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;color:#111111;"></span>
	</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="background:white;">
		<span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:Arial;">One very common and destructive daily habit is to constantly compare your life and yourself to other people and their lives. You compare cars, houses, jobs, shoes, money, relationships,   social popularity and so on. And at the end of the day you pummel your self-esteem to the ground and you create a lot of negative feelings.</span>
	</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="background:white;">
		<b><span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:Arial;">How to overcome this habit:</span></b><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;color:#111111;"></span>
	</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="background:white;">
		<span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:Arial;">Replace that destructive habit with two other habits.</span>
	</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:15.0pt;text-indent:-.25in;background:white;">
		<!--[if !supportLists]--><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Wingdings;color:#111111;"><span><span style="font-family:Arial;">§</span><span style="font-family:Arial;">&nbsp; </span></span></span><!--[endif]--><b><span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:Arial;">Compare yourself to yourself.&nbsp;</span></b><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;color:#111111;"><span style="font-family:Arial;">First, instead of comparing yourself   to other people create the habit of comparing yourself to yourself. See how much you have grown, what you have achieved and what progress you have made towards your goals.&nbsp;This habit has the benefit of creating gratitude, appreciation and kindness towards   yourself as you observe how far you have come, the obstacles you have overcome and the good stuff you have done.</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Arial;"> You feel good about yourself without having to think less of other people.</span></span>
	</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:15.0pt;text-indent:-.25in;background:white;">
		<!--[if !supportLists]--><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Wingdings;color:#111111;"><span><span style="font-family:Arial;">§</span><span style="font-family:Arial;">&nbsp; </span></span></span><!--[endif]--><b><span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:Arial;">Be kind.</span></b><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;color:#111111;"><span style="font-family:Arial;">&nbsp;In my experience, the way you behave and think towards   others seems to have a big, big effect on how you behave towards yourself and think about yourself. Judge and criticize people more and you tend to judge and criticize yourself more (often almost automatically). Be more kind to other people and help them and   you tend to be more kind and helpful to yourself.</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Arial;"> Focus on the positive things in yourself and in the people around you. Appreciate what is positive in yourself and others. This way you become more OK with yourself and the people in your world instead of ranking them and yourself and creating differences in   your mind.</span></span>
	</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="background:white;">
		<span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:Arial;">And remember, you can’t win if you keep comparing. Just consciously realizing this can be helpful. No matter what you do you can pretty much always find someone else in the world that   has more than you or are better than you at something.</span>
	</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="background:white;">
		<b><span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:Arial;">5. Focusing on the negative details in life.</span></b><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;color:#111111;"></span>
	</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="background:white;">
		<span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:Arial;">Seeing the negative aspects of whichever situation you are in and dwelling on those details is a sure way to make yourself unhappy. And to drag down the mood for everyone around you.</span>
	</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="background:white;">
		<b><span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:Arial;">How to overcome this habit:</span></b><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;color:#111111;"></span>
	</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="background:white;">
		<span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:Arial;">Overcoming this habit can be tricky. One thing that has worked for me is to kick the perfectionism habit. You accept that things and situations will have their upsides and downsides   rather than thinking that all details have to positive and excellent. You accept things as they are. This way you can let go emotionally and mentally of what is negative instead of dwelling on it and making mountains out of molehills.</span>
	</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="background:white;">
		<span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:Arial;">Another thing that works is simply to focus on being constructive. Instead of focusing on dwelling and whining about the negative detail. You can do so by asking better questions. Questions   like:</span>
	</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="background:white;">
		<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;color:#111111;"><span style="font-family:Arial;">How can I turn this negative thing into something helpful or positive?</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Arial;"> How can I solve this problem?</span></span>
	</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="background:white;">
		<span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:Arial;">If I am faced with what I start thinking is a problem I may use a third solution, I may ask myself: who cares? I most often then realize that this isn’t really a problem in the long   run at all.</span>
	</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="background:white;">
		<b><span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:Arial;">6. Limiting life because you believe the world revolves around you.</span></b><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;color:#111111;"></span>
	</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="background:white;">
		<span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:Arial;">If you think that the world revolves around you and you hold yourself back because you are afraid what people may think or say if you do something that different or new then you are   putting some big limits on your life. How?</span>
	</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="background:white;">
		<span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:Arial;">Well, you can become less open to trying new things and growing. You can think that the criticism and negativity you encounter is about you or that it is your fault all the time (while   it in reality could be about the other person having bad week or you thinking that you can read minds). I have also found that my own shyness used to come from me thinking that people cared a great deal about what I was about to say or do.</span>
	</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="background:white;">
		<b><span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:Arial;">How to overcome this habit:</span></b><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;color:#111111;"></span>
	</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:15.0pt;text-indent:-.25in;background:white;">
		<!--[if !supportLists]--><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Wingdings;color:#111111;"><span><span style="font-family:Arial;">§</span><span style="font-family:Arial;">&nbsp; </span></span></span><!--[endif]--><b><span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:Arial;">Realize people don’t care too much about what you do.&nbsp;</span></b><span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:Arial;">They have   their hands full with worrying about their own lives and what people may think of them instead. Yes, this might make you feel less important in your own head. But it also sets you free a bit more if you’d like that.</span>
	</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:15.0pt;text-indent:-.25in;background:white;">
		<!--[if !supportLists]--><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Wingdings;color:#111111;"><span><span style="font-family:Arial;">§</span><span style="font-family:Arial;">&nbsp; </span></span></span><!--[endif]--><b><span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:Arial;">Focus outward.</span></b><span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:Arial;">&nbsp;Instead of thinking about yourself and how people   may perceive you all the time, focus outward on the people around you. Listen to them and help them. This will help you to raise your self-esteem and help you to reduce that self-centered focus.</span>
	</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="background:white;">
		<b><span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:Arial;">7. Overcomplicating life.</span></b><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;color:#111111;"></span>
	</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="background:white;">
		<span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:Arial;">Life can be pretty complicated. This can creates stress and unhappiness. But much of this is often created by us. Yes, the world may be becoming more complex but that doesn’t mean that   we cannot create new habits that make your own lives a bit simpler.</span>
	</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="background:white;">
		<b><span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:Arial;">How to overcome this habit:</span></b><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;color:#111111;"></span>
	</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="background:white;">
		<span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:Arial;">Overcomplicating life can involve many habits but I’d like to suggest a few replacement habits to what have been a couple of my own most overcomplicating habits.</span>
	</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:15.0pt;text-indent:-.25in;background:white;">
		<!--[if !supportLists]--><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Wingdings;color:#111111;"><span><span style="font-family:Arial;">§</span><span style="font-family:Arial;">&nbsp; </span></span></span><!--[endif]--><b><span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:Arial;">Splitting your focus and having your attention all over the place in everyday life.&nbsp;</span></b><span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:Arial;">I   replaced that complicating habit with just doing one thing at a time during my day, having a small to-do list with 2-3 very important items and writing down my most important goal on white board that I see each day.</span>
	</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:15.0pt;text-indent:-.25in;background:white;">
		<!--[if !supportLists]--><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Wingdings;color:#111111;"><span><span style="font-family:Arial;">§</span><span style="font-family:Arial;">&nbsp; </span></span></span><!--[endif]--><b><span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:Arial;">Having too much stuff.&nbsp;</span></b><span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:Arial;">I replaced that habit with regularly asking   myself: have I used this in the past year? If not then I will give that thing away or throw it away.</span>
	</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:15.0pt;text-indent:-.25in;background:white;">
		<!--[if !supportLists]--><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Wingdings;color:#111111;"><span><span style="font-family:Arial;">§</span><span style="font-family:Arial;">&nbsp; </span></span></span><!--[endif]--><b><span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:Arial;">Creating relationship problems of any kind in your mind.</span></b><span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:Arial;">&nbsp;Reading   minds is hard. So, instead ask questions and communicate. This will help you to minimize unnecessary conflicts, misunderstandings, negativity and waste or time and energy.</span>
	</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:15.0pt;text-indent:-.25in;background:white;">
		<!--[if !supportLists]--><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Wingdings;color:#111111;"><span><span style="font-family:Arial;">§</span><span style="font-family:Arial;">&nbsp; </span></span></span><!--[endif]--><b><span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:Arial;">Getting lost in the in-box.</span></b><span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:Arial;">&nbsp;I spend less time and energy on my   email in-box by just checking it once a day and writing shorter emails (if possible not more than 5 sentences.)</span>
	</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:15.0pt;text-indent:-.25in;background:white;">
		<!--[if !supportLists]--><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Wingdings;color:#111111;"><span><span style="font-family:Arial;">§</span><span style="font-family:Arial;">&nbsp; </span></span></span><!--[endif]--><b><span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:Arial;">Getting lost in stress and overwhelm.&nbsp;</span></b><span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:Arial;">When stressed, lost in a   problem or the past or future in your mind then, as I mentioned above, breathe with your belly for two minutes and just focus on the air going in and out. This will calm your body down and bring your mind back into the present moment again. Then you can start   focusing on doing what is most important for you again.</span>
