We shouldn't choose companies based on their benefits and perks.   If you don't feel connected to the company's mission, then those things are merely bribes. When the honeymoon period of your new job wears off, and you get used to the benefits and perks so they no longer feel special, you could end up with a job you don't   really like.

We're so used to going to job boards when we think it's time to look for a new position. It's automatic. It's easy. The companies   are served up to us and we sit and try to fit ourselves into their roles. But, if you step back and think about it, that's like forcing a square peg in a round hole. It's also like going to the used car lot and being told you can only buy what's on display   - very limiting! Even still, the idea of creating our own customized list of ideal employers, as smart as it is, may feel a little intimidating - maybe even a bit indulgent. Nobody's ever given you free reign to choose your employer before, have they? I'm   here to tell you it's the best way for you to find a good employer efficiently.

The goal is to identify five people at each company and find ways to connect with them. Obviously, a referral by a shared connection is your best   bet. But, if you don't have a shared connection, you are going to have to step out of your comfort zone and try to connect with strangers. This is not as hard as you think. You can customize a request to connect on LinkedIn, or even use an Inmail to write   a longer email asking to connect. The goal is to ask them to connect in hopes you an learn more about the company and what it might take to earn a position there. Stress to them that you aren't looking for them to help you get a job, just some insight as to   what the process is like. Not everyone will connect, but this is a numbers game. All you need is one person to connect and speak with you and you'll be on your way.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p style="margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:18.0pt;background:white;vertical-align:baseline;font-stretch: inherit;box-sizing: border-box;orphans: auto;text-align:start;widows: auto;-webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;word-spacing:0px">  <strong><span style="font-family:inherit;color:#4D4F51;border:none windowtext 1.0pt;padding:0in">The more people you connect with, the closer you get to your next job.</span></strong><span style="font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:#4D4F51"><o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p style="mso-margin-top-alt:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:22.5pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:18.0pt;background:white;vertical-align:baseline;font-stretch: inherit;box-sizing: border-box;orphans: auto;text-align:start;widows: auto;-webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;word-spacing:0px">  <span style="font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:#4D4F51">As you connect with people at companies on your Interview Bucket List, you may think you have nothing in common with them, but you are so wrong! Think about it, you share a passion - you both   admire and respect the company the connection works for. This means you could have a meaningful conversation around the company's products or services that could help you get to know each other better. This is what networking is - a chance to exchange thoughts   and ideas to build mutual trust and respect. If you approach your networking with the mindset that you are just looking to have interesting conversations with like-minded professionals, you'll find it easier to develop relationships with your connections.   Better still, these conversations will lead to discussions about other companies (i.e. previous places the person has worked at, competitors, etc.), which you can then research and potentially add to your list.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p style="margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:18.0pt;background:white;vertical-align:baseline;font-stretch: inherit;box-sizing: border-box;orphans: auto;text-align:start;widows: auto;-webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;word-spacing:0px">  <strong><span style="font-family:inherit;color:#4D4F51;border:none windowtext 1.0pt;padding:0in">Now, here's where the job search gets easier:</span></strong><span style="font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:#4D4F51"><o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p style="mso-margin-top-alt:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:22.5pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:18.0pt;background:white;vertical-align:baseline;font-stretch: inherit;box-sizing: border-box;orphans: auto;text-align:start;widows: auto;-webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;word-spacing:0px">  <span style="font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:#4D4F51">80% of all jobs are gotten via referral. The process works like this: A person you know, knows someone who is hiring and refers you. What you may not know is most of these types of referrals are   from second level connections. It's not usually your direct friends and family that refer you to your next job. More commonly, it's a friend of a friend, or in this case, a connection of a connection, who refers you to the job. Why does this happen? People   who aren't as deeply connected to us have an easier time referring a stranger to a job. It actually makes sense. If you refer a person you don't know very well but comes recommend to you by a colleague or friend, you can easily say to the hiring manager, &quot;____   recommended her for the job. I don't know her very well, but she seems like someone worth checking out.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p style="mso-margin-top-alt:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:22.5pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:18.0pt;background:white;vertical-align:baseline;font-stretch: inherit;box-sizing: border-box;orphans: auto;text-align:start;widows: auto;-webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;word-spacing:0px">  <span style="font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:#4D4F51">Based on the above, can you see how having a targeted list of people at companies you admire and respect might be the smartest way to expand your network and get referred to a company you'd like   to work for?<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p style="margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:18.0pt;background:white;vertical-align:baseline;font-stretch: inherit;box-sizing: border-box;orphans: auto;text-align:start;widows: auto;-webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;word-spacing:0px">  <strong><span style="font-family:inherit;color:#4D4F51;border:none windowtext 1.0pt;padding:0in">I will admit, there is one hard part.</span></strong><span style="font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:#4D4F51"><o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p style="margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:18.0pt;background:white;vertical-align:baseline;font-stretch: inherit;box-sizing: border-box;orphans: auto;text-align:start;widows: auto;-webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;word-spacing:0px">  <span style="font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:#4D4F51">While the process above isn't complex, I will be fair and tell you that the one place you can feel some frustration is in the research phase of the companies. Sadly, companies just don't share   enough information about themselves so job seekers can determine if they feel connected to the business. I tell my clients to study the company website, follow them on LinkedIn and Glassdoor, and do a thorough internet search to read articles on their accomplishments.   But even then, it's not always enough. [In fact, I've been so bothered by this challenge for job seekers that my company decided to start a program to let employers know when job seekers want more info from them.</span><span class="apple-converted-space"><span style="font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:#4D4F51">&nbsp;</span></span><span style="font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:#4D4F51"><a href="http://www.careerealism.com/company-referral-program/" target="_blank"><span style="font-family:inherit;color:#7B539D;border:none windowtext 1.0pt;padding:0in">It's   FREE to job seekers - you can learn more here.</span></a>]<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p style="mso-margin-top-alt:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:22.5pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:18.0pt;background:white;vertical-align:baseline;font-stretch: inherit;box-sizing: border-box;orphans: auto;text-align:start;widows: auto;-webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;word-spacing:0px">  <span style="font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:#4D4F51">I can tell you this: if you don't do your due diligence, you won't be able to generate the admiration and respect you need to put that company on your Interview Bucket List.

If you can't be bothered to take control of your job search and focus your efforts on the kinds of companies you'd be most excited   to work for, then you don't deserve to work for them. You may feel that's harsh, but it's true. You are a business-of-one. Your marketing efforts will determine the kind of clients (a/ka/ employers) you land. Which means, if you believe you deserve a good   employer and a great career, then make the effort. Nobody's going to hand it to you. Otherwise, accept that you've taken the easy route and be happy with what you get.

However, that also means more people who have been working in jobs they hate will   start to look for new employers. The competition for the best jobs will heat up. The sooner you start your list, the sooner you an network your way into a job with an employer of your choosing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  </div>  </div>
