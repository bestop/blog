Do not   deprive yourself of the love you need.<BR><BR>People part their ways after   living together for years and years. Though this looks strange but is the   obvious result of ignoring the genuine complaints and grievances of the other.   Sometimes a sincere apology, gentle touch, or a friendly kiss is enough to put   your love life on track. However, when deep differences develop between the two   then professional consultation is necessary. Do everything to bring back love to   your life, if it is lost.<BR><BR>In order to make the journey of life more   exciting and enjoyable, you need a loving and caring person with whom you can   share your values, dreams, fantasies, joys and jokes. In difficult times of   anxiety, sorrow, distress or loss of near and dear ones this person should stand   firm besides you and console you in every possible manner.<BR><BR>Love your life   and love the person who is in your life.
